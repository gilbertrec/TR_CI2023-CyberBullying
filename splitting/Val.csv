Recap   I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion  Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows   The result was Delete The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm and that the references do not support the notability of the subject Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic and I have counted those opinions as being from UserJulie Dancer Kevin talk   As for The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm  In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist namely Examples of relevant works are A Fast BottomUp Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with NearOptimal Generalization and An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees which are capable of performing the function the article title names  If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion  In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read The algorithm used for this purpose to One algorithm used for this purpose Since I do not now have access to the articles history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time However it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion Incidentally it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history  Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way The Wikipedia still claims to be the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit    The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves   As for references not supporting the notability of the subject  You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment these arguments were not clearly refuted All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains  As for The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic  This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line  Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w,0.0

Sorry but Wikipedia disagrees with you and so does the US Government in the person of the Securities and Exchange Commission  The Xcom company was then renamed PayPal in 2001 Thats a quote from Wikipedias PayPal article The article references PayPals own history which states that 1 in March 2000 Confinity merges with Xcom taking on its company name and 2 in June 2001 PayPal officially takes its name Xcom officially changes its name to PayPal to match the name of its most popular product Id say that was pretty conclusive But theres more Your comments about Xcom and Confinity becoming part of PayPal represents a complete misunderstanding of how company law works A company is a legal entity there were two entities and then one of them was swallowed by the other and ceased to exist If youre not sure about that just check the SEC here This site is the definitive record so theres no getting round what it says It shows TWO companies called PayPal not one PayPal Funds Inc was formerly Xcom Funds and is essentially a bagman for PayPal Inc And this document supplied by shareholders states that PayPal Inc resulted from a merger between Confinity Inc and Xcom Corporation As for the name change the document states that We incorporated as Xcom Corporation in March 1999 On March 30 2000 Xcom merged with Confinity Inc with Xcom as the surviving entity We formally changed our name to PayPal Inc in February 2001 So there you have it from the horses mouth and accepted as fact by the SEC XCom Inc swallowed Confinity Inc which ceased to exist Some time later XCom became PayPal Inc XComs financial infrastructure became PayPals financial infrastructure It would be misleading in the extreme to say anything else,0.0

Oh my research was done but I was busy I can send you the book if you want my curiosity has faded Anyway long story short is he is not descendant directly fro Chingiz Khan his hero so to speak he is descendant from what it seems like a Mongolian Family that have been Turkicized Temürs marriage to a Chinggisid princess the daughter of Qazan Khan gave him the right to use the title kürgän or imperial son in law which was also adopted by several of his descendants and he attempted to revive the Chinggisid house through the elevation of puppet khans in the Ulus Chaghadai my source is the new Cambridge History of Islam I can send it to you if you like on the Mughals part they see themselves as Timurids but the correct word is Gurkani a simple google book search has concluded me that Baburs diary called Baburnama edited by Thackston in 2002 may contain the Gurkani material,0.0

Thats the common expression on internet fora for followers of Judaism and citizens of Israel who push for certain issues to be seen their way The fact of the matter is that Jerusalem is not the internationally recognized capital of Israel Its status is yet to be determinded in negotiations with a future PalestinianArab government of an independent and unoccupied Palestine The personal opinions of Jews or Israelis who want to depict the situation in a way sympathetic to them for obvious reasons cannot dictate the content of an internationally accessible article on wikipedia This is no propaganda platform and the want to post their minority opinion they should mark it as that,0.0

Question about WikiProject South Carolina   Greetings I have been watching WikiProject South Carolina for a while and it doesnt appear to be very active and I had a proposition for the members to consider I would like to pull WPUS under WikiProject United States to some degree I am not necessarily talking a full merger unless thats what the members of WPSC want but here is what I mean The project would stay the way it is except for a couple things I would like to replace  with  and add WPSC to the list of Projects supported by WPUS This would include replacing the WPSC template on the talk pages of the articles with WPUSSouth Carolina if you want to see an examply you camn look at Washington DC I would also add it to the list of Projects supported by WPUS on the main WPUS landing page This would do a couple things that I think would benefit both projects It would increase visibility of South Carolina and related articles to a much larger user base It would allow WPSC to more easily benefit from the Bots running for WPUS This includes article alert bot that warns of Articles and Images for deletion or Promotion This would ensure maximum visibility if an article relating to South Carolina was submitted for deletion or promotion It would allow the South Carolina related articles to fall under the WPUS and South Carolina scope It would somewhat reduce the maintenance required by consolidating the templates It would reduce the number of templates visibile on the articles In addition to the above I typically cycle through all the articles in the WPUS scope every month or 2 fixing various things sections typos persondata categories etc and this would allow the South Carolina articles to fall under that much more easily Please let me know what thoughts or ideas you have about this and if the other members would be receptive to this I also added a message to the talk page of WikiProject South Carolina Thanks in advance,0.0
Omega and Chaos  In a certain mythology not known as of yet omega and chaos are believed to be spirits of the Earth Omega being the protector or guardian of Earth and chaos being the armageddon or end of Earth Supposodely when chaos and desolence is about the Earth or is bought forth upoun the Earth Omega is awakened to balance out the excess  And vice versa is omega awakens with the goal of sending the planet to the stars chaos comes to balance out the excess so there isnt really a bad guy in this situation  Whatever  this has precisely nothing to do with the topic of Alpha and Omega Christianity Go to Alpha and Omega disambiguation and see if anything there is relevant if you can document your assertions of course    Omega is NOT protector NOR guardian of Earth because Sampi instead really bears this function Remember that Greek alphabet has over 30 letters    this guy is just spewing from Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerberus    Alpha and Sampi   Full global Greek alphabet is as follows  Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ϝ Ϛ Ζ Η Ͱ Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ϻ Ϸ Ϟ Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω Ͳ  It begins with Alpha and ends with Sampi That means that Omega in this case is not final letter because after Omega is placed too Sampi Due to this fact in this case God is not only local Ionian Alpha and Omega because He is in this case too Somebody more  global PanGreek Alpha and Sampi This fact should be acknowledged by all Christians that uses global Greek Alphabet because in this case they can diminish God by excluding Him from full range of global Greek Alphabet Ionians were justified by their unknowledge and Jesus only adjusted Himself to their lower level of knowledge calling Himself as local Ionian Beginning and End Sho was placed between San and Qoppa and was only existing Greek letter not used by Greeks but by Bactrians that adopted Greek alphabet Comparison page is here    Im sorry but Sampi was a kludge whereby a corrupt form of an archaic letter formerly between Pi and Qoppa was dragged in so that there would be 27 distinct symbols for the purposes of Isopsephy while Sho was used in Central Asia to transcribe nonGreek languages Neither of these symbols was ever used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language which is the only thing which is relevant for the Bible    Thus that would mean that Sampi was corrupted version of San that is placed between Pi and Qoppa    Probably it was though there is still some debate over the matter But regardless of its origin it still was never used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language which is the only thing thats relevant for this article    Because Tshaped alphabetic Sampi was introduced recently to Wikipedia I think that it is in Tshape not corrupted but fully fledged letter For proof look into Sampi article to compare alphabetic TSampi and numeric CSampi As you see TSampi is more like russian П and too Greek PI with addition of  while CSampi is more like russian Э and too Greek LUNATE EPSILON with addition of  In this way TSampi should be primary and CSampi secondary    Its a fullyfledged numerical symbol but it wasnt a letter and its not relevant to this article    Tshaped Sampi was really alphabetic letter with ss value what is stated even in Greek alphabet article in obsolete letter section but Cshaped Sampi is mainly numerical symbol derived from previous alphabetic symbol    In other words it was probably a medieval manuscript ligature disigma or sigmasigma identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol sampi  as was exactly the case with the medieval manuscript ligature stigma sigmatau identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol digamma  However the New Testament period chronologically preceded the peri,0.0

Bewt Gingriches Military Brat Childhood  Biography  This article glosses over and therefore misses a richley different aspect of Gingriches upbringing Like about 10 million Americans Newt was a military brat child of a career military family this was a very different way of growing up with unique challenges and benefits The article implies that somehow Newt is from Pennsilvania which reveals the common tenedency to misunderstand a military childhood in fact Gingrich grew up on a series of military bases in a number of places Military brats face unique challenges moving constantly throughout ones childhood constantly having to say good bye to friends the strictness of life on military bases and in nearby military dominated towns but also military brats tend to have unique skills which this article also needs to expand upon a knack for quickly developing relationships with people a resulting social savvyness and broader and more culturally diverse world view and also a military aptitude for strategy leadership and even Generalship    A more accurate study of Newts life would reveal that such an upbringing may have much to do with the original foundations of his genius for political strategy as one of the masterminds and Generals of the Republican revolution of the early ninteys   Expanding on the military dimension of Gingriches childhood and what it means to be an American military child is needed in order to make this a truely representative article   Sincerely,0.0
UNPRODUCTIVE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS or why the word PRACTISED is not the case of Lubitzs earlier actions Very often people who intend to commit suicide have had many interrupted attempts to do it when suicidal impulse is not strong enough to overcome natural fear and resistance of rational thought For example people trying to commit suicide with a gun often put the weapon to their head and then they interrupt this action moments before they pull the trigger Viewed from the side those unsuccessful suicide attempts are like theatrical act but this is just an illusion because every such attempt has the potential to end tragically In the case of Lubitz  in the situation in which he intended to carry out his suicide there are several circumstances that limit his freedom of choice to interrupt the suicidal attempt  such as returning of the Captain or what you are doing in the cabin These circumstances can force his unproductive suicide attempts to became productive one in any moment and he knows that after them he will have no choice to turn back For this reason it is normal he to do first timid attempts  which were unsuccessful in the first flight Duesseldorf to Barcelona because time is not limited On his return back Barcelona to Duesseldorf the end destination is forcing him As I said he has not PRACTISED but was TRYING to commit suicide or in other words  he had unproductive suicide attempt,0.0

It is about improving the article The subsections title promises to clarify whether length contraction is real physical shortening of an object or just apparent shortening Then Einstein is quoted as affirming that changes as seen from different frames are real changes So as per my obvious example length contraction must claim that Earths diameter really contracts in thousands of different ways depending on the velocity and direction of thousands of different observers ie that its diameter really is 4000 miles as measured from the frame approaching at 866c Whatever applies to the length of a rod must also apply to the length of Earths diameter No straw man about it Do not continue to mistake such criticism for ignorance,0.0

Ive got to say Ive read you pacafistic rules seen your idea of logic and have heard tales of your justification and I just have to say  I have this to say on my behavior Im a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements even when they are against my favor I change subjects help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong ask them for proper information that I might use against them basically anything a scatter brainer would do  I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top I treat both equelly and I dont get angry when someone yells in my face  Why should I They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them sound fimiliar I give them their space though I would still do what I diddo to annoy them Except I do it without coming into contact with them as they would do to me which I know wed both appreciate  I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesntblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable Others cant resolve the problem only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both see below  If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to because I wouldnt because I have no reason to because we shouldnt have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it Conflict is stupid Almost but not quite as stupid as the species that createembrace it Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve  Now I have this to say about the good people of wikipedia Wow There sure arent a lot of you I wonder why Youve seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits you think you know what to expect Well you have most of it down But you went wrong at a few turns 1 You blindly follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit theyre full of  2 You think you got human psychology in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane  3 You dont want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POVpoint of views but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it  You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right You are NO ONE to interpret what mad kind eccentric ect is Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else wed look and be exactly the same And you dont want that  And dont you tell me to calm down I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way and it certainly isnt any diffent with Bots   4 Most importantly you robots are full of shit You take leadersfavorites who take favorites who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they dont knowwhat else to do Sickening  2a You abuse your power instead of embracing its enlightenment Dont you get it He wasnt going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself But he didnt He wanted to add insult to injury  You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to NO They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embracedin  We all want what we shouldnt have  Unfortunately there are some of us who already have what we shouldnt have  5 How you go about it is the wrong way  Some things people must learn for themselves You have a problem try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve   If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let thembutt out and leave them to their bickering Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own accountor reasoning Or they may even just stop BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit things will get much worse  Ill let you know whether you care or not You came in and took his side of the argument and banned me for 24 hours hoping that would teach me a lesson and make me think twice about wikietiquette But you must already know before I just wanted him to stay off my talk page Now I want to kill him for r,1.0

Really To publish peoples works for whatever reasons without authorisation is breaching copyright I want my pages removed from geocities and am having a lot of trouble finding who to write to to have this fixed The owner of the website at geocities is also hidden in a domain search so there is no contact details easily foundAt least the guy from reocities was easy to contact and took my pages off as asked Anyone publishing pages where the copyright is held by someone else should be prepared for some irate people asking to have those pages removed I moved my pages to my own server but left a copy on my geocities site knowing geocities was going to die I just wanted to be there at the end Never did I think people would start copying my pages I wrote one essay on there when I was 15 it means so much to me Take my pages down please geocities you have no right to them,0.0
True that its not a USonly project but consensus at WikiProject Television has shifted away from perfunctory inclusion of startsends in Englishspeaking nations unless there is a noteworthy reason to do so  If this were a German series I would argue that US airdates arent within the scope of our interest  Similarly I think the German info is not necessary  Yours is a reasonable argument for inclusion of the French dub since it did make press Anyhow not worth a fight but if it does get removed the consensus is already there,0.0

Free Software  Open Source   In many articles you show your intention to use the phrase free and open source  The best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves If you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term I have no objection If the developers use free software it is best to use exactly that for that specific program If the developers of a certain program use only open source and the license of the program is indeed an open source license Excluding the GNU GPL Its text explicitly uses the term free software then its ok to use that description   The purpose is that the reader should not understand the word free to mean gratis in this case Unfortunately just using free alone makes it more likely that people will understand gratis  If you software into that phrase free and open source something like open source and free software it would be better,0.0

Hello Zwack GB and welcome to Wikipedia Thank you for   I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest In other words you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way because you are work for or represent the subject of that article Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason   To reduce the chances of deletion you might like to draft your article before submission then ask me or any other editor to proofread it To start creating a draft article just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit that page as you would any other If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page  The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation If your username does have such a name it would be advisable for you to request a change of username  If you are stuck and looking for help please come to the New contributors help page where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have You can also just type  on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions Here are a few other good links for newcomers The five pillars of Wikipedia How to edit a page Help pages Tutorial How to write a great article Manual of Style I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian Please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes  this will automatically produce your name and the date If you have any questions check out WikipediaWhere to ask a question or ask me on my talk page Again welcome,0.0

Correction to get the crest accepted by Wikipedia you dont need to have it on more than one page In fact for most fair use ie copyrighted images chances are that they can only be fairly used on one page What you need is a good reason to use it the official logo of a company institution  is acceptable if that is a usual way of identifying the institution You can eg see the fair use rationale of the Nike logo here,0.0

The following quotes are taken verbatim from the Appaloosa talk page They are made by editors who self identified themselves as female To my knowledge they have never been admonished or cautioned for these very questionable remarks I on the other hand find myself permanently blocked by dreadstar The nature of dread stars gender is immaterial to the obvious fact that I am being subjected to a double standard of scrutiny and punishment because I dont have a second X chromosome  Or do you claim that this is also a fringe theory I hope this matter can be settled here without recourse to an appeal to higher scrutiny And I want either my edit restored as a just and rightful response to this rather catty calumny Or I want these feminine offenses to common manners to be equally expunged  The Daily Mail presents Engstroms theory that Americanborn Scott always believed they came from Asia across the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia As Ealdgyth points out with links to scientific literature that assertion is simply patent nonsense and WPFRINGE  The Daily Mail such an expert source also presents Engstroms theory that there are fewer than 200 true Appaloosas left in the world That is also patent nonsense The Appaloosa museum explains that there were about 200 officially registered Appaloosas in 1947 By 1978 there were 300000 living and deceased of course Today there are 635000 This breed isnt even close to rare  But Scott has often questioned this history because she thinks the numbers of spotted horses that were in the Pacific northwest part of America when explorers Lewis and Clark first made their way over the Rockies in the early 1800s didnt quite tally with her experience of being a breeder She said there were too many of them for that to be the case so shed always had this theory that maybe horses had come across the Pacific into America by a different route  THAT is a fringe theory,0.0

10 May 2006 UTC  Im not sure one can draw exact parallels between mechanistic nonsubluxation based and Vitalistic subluxationbased chiropractors although it would generally be true While some mechanistic chiros may choose to limit their practice they can still be Vitalists OTOH Vitalism is an integral part of the belief in vertebral subluxations VS It all depends on how you choose to define Vitalism In a general sense all healthcare practitioners know that the body has inherent abilities to heal itself This has never been unique to chiropractic and predates it Vitalism in its religiousmetaphysical sense also predates chiropractic and Palmer but is the basis for Palmers development of the concepts of Universal Intelligence UI and Innate Intelligence II I can conceive of some subluxationbased chiropractors not being conscious and informed believers in UI IOW they are actually mechanistic subluxationbased chiros Even some professed atheists can believe in some sort of supernatural entity They will tend to confuse VS for orthopedic subluxations considering them to be the same Truly informed and practicing Vitalistic subluxationbased chiros the Planet chiro and FACE type are normally members of the ICA or WCA and understand the difference and that is that VS has a metaphysical element that is the unique property of chiropractic Without this principle difference chiropractic loses its uniqueness When it comes down to it belief in VS is the most fundamental difference between chiropractors and influences many other things about the way they think and practice  Here is something about chiropractic and Vitalism  The debate over whether life is controlled by spiritual or material forces peaked in the nineteenth century By this time scientists endorsing spiritual control began to refer to themselves as vitalists Vitalism according to the MerriamWebster dictionary is the doctrine that the processes of life are not explainable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is in some part selfdetermining Vitalists contended that some vital factor as distinct from physiochemical factors was involved with controlling the bodys structure and function Since the definition of vitalism emphasizes that its character is beyond the laws of physics measurement vitalistic mechanisms were outside of the defined parameters of modern science In spite of its metaphysical nature vitalism was still endorsed by many traditional nineteenth century scientists   The support for vitalism was soundly shaken in 1859 when Charles Darwin published his Origin of Species In his treatise on evolution theory Darwin emphasized that internalized hereditary factors the existence of genes had not yet been recognized were responsible for controlling the character of evolving species Within a decade of its presentation Darwinian theory was endorsed by the majority of conventional scientists Darwins theory of evolution denied the role of spirit or life force in the unfoldment of life on this planet Consequently scientists myopically focused on the search for the internalized material elements that controlled biological organisms   D D Palmer was very sensitive to scientists displeasure concerning concepts related to spirit and vital forces In formulating the original science of Chiropractic he coined the terms Universal Intelligence and Innate Intelligence to refer to the inherent organizing intelligence of the Universe and of life   In the early years of Chiropractic I used the terms Innate Spirit Innate Intelligence Spiritual Intellect Universal Intelligence God because they were comprehensive and the world was not prepared to receive the latter terms just mentioned in parentheses It may be even now premature to use them page 542 The Science Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic  Since vitalism is at the heart of chiropractic philosophy and vitalism is perceived as metaphysics the philosophy of chiropractic is not recognized by conventional medical science Though modern medicine consider chiropractic as unscientific it has not been able to ignore the large number of their patients that have been increasingly satisfied with chiropractic care The success of Chiropractic in recent years has fueled the antagonism between conventional medical physicians and chiropractors Biomedical research scientists are at a loss to explain the efficacy of chiropractic adjustment for it is in direct opposition to contemporary knowledge concerning biological control mechanisms  Bruce H Lipton PhD Todays Chiropractic SeptOct 1998 1619   Another interesting quoteN,0.0

Hello Im assuming you are the articles creator but you have not logged in Anyhow  I used the standard English transliteration of his name but Im happy to move the article for the time being Do you have any examples of him or one of his descendants  being mentioned in non Russian sources That might help but note that European languages vary in how they transliterate Russian For example English Tchaikovsky Italian Čajkovskij German Tschaikowski French Tchaïkovski I note also that in your draft you referred to his wife at least once as as Yanina Shuysky not Shuisky with his wife Yanina Shuysky performing as Aida As for the role list when the operas have their own article and are linked the composer is superfluous and you certainly dont need to keep repeating opera by See Simon Keenlyside and JeanÉtienneAuguste Massol for examples of properly done role lists So please dont add the composer back I can make the images slightly smaller if you wish but they should never sandwich the text as they were here Here is a guide which will help to learn the formatting and style we use on English Wikipedia WikipediaSimplified Manual of Style Best wishes,0.0

Wow   Youre one of those guys whose idea of contribution is retribution by deleting others comments arent you  Figures  The gender gap will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on The only cultural bias Wikipedia has is that it is biased towards objectively important subjects such as science which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all The undue coverage of women comes from the fact that there are less notable women Insisting on equal coverage of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and nonnotable people The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women such as illconceived politeness will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done,1.0

Well the article mentions how the natives utilize celestial events for timing certain things knowing when cycles are beginning and so on but in my opinion this is not astrology Astrology entails the belief that celestial events alignments angles etc correlate with earthly affairs in ways that are not obviously causal eg it being dark because the Sun has set Using the constellations to know when to gather eggs for instance is a far cry from a Western astrologer consulting an individuals nativity to see when she will get married It really isnt a tradition of astrology in this sense as it isnt as organized and conceptual although if the astrological tendencies are there it may be relevant for CategoryAstrology and perhaps even an article rename,0.0

Plato not part of the Socratic entourage or inner circle At the beginning of the Plato and Socrates section of the article someone had said Plato made himself seem as though he were part of the Socratic entourage but never says so explicitly    In the Apology Plato distances himself from the inner circle  I believe this involves a misunderstanding of how Plato represents himself in the Apology  I would not be prepared to say that Plato considered himself part of Socrates entourage or Socrates inner circle but thats only because its not clear what whoever wrote this part of the article means by entourage or inner circle  Is it made clear elsewhere in Platos dialogues who did belong to the inner circle  So far as I know Plato never mentions an inner circle  But he certainly portrays himself in the Apology as one of Socrates young devoted followers in quite explicit terms in fact  Given this fact I think its simply misleading to suggest that Plato somehow went out of his way to distance himself from Socrates or Socrates devoted followers  So Ive edited this part of the article accordingly including textual citations  Comment if you wish,0.0

The book Die Nemesis von Potsdam has 47 pages of bibliography  archives demographic studies official publications of the US Great Britain France Switzerland Poland etc besides secondary literature  These sources are tken into account in some 1000 footnotes in the book and brought up to date in the 14th revised and enlarged edition which you can borrow from any library  As far as German statistics on the deaths that resulted from the evacuationflightexpulsion of the Germans the figure of 2 million deaths is considered to be on the low side of the spectrum As you may know the German Red Cross Statistisches Bundesamt Heimatortskarteien Gesamterhebung and other professional not amateur institutions carried out careful demographic studies especially in connection with the search for missing persons  This work was carried out over many years and the results were always the same  between 2 and 3 million missing and dead  The fact that Poland was a victim of aggression and war crimes by both Germany and the Soviet Union does not justify or legalize the crimes committed against East Prussian farmers Silesian coal miners factory workers and their families  JvA,0.0

Yes it is implied but I dislike implications within a definition even when they are correct And I believe a general reader may share the sentiment or even get confused  Decades ago before computers it was important to make simple equations even simpler To that aim static equilibrium was used in some accelerating system problems of course with the inertial forces included the approach was credited to dAlembert A simple example would be to determine maximum acceleration of a motorbike for a given friction coefficient no limitation on engine power When solved in the accelerating frame in which the center of mass was at rest one could use torques about any point as both static equilibrium conditions apply and achieve minor simplifications in calculation As I recall one would casually refer to that accelerating frame as the motorbike CM frame Why not the meaning was perfectly clear and what authority might there be to forbid such usage  That being said I am aware of the fact that relativistic particle collisions are best described in inertial COM frames Some authors call them COM systems as eg in the Sears and Zeemansky College Physics They even claim that COM system is a relativistic generalization of CM system  people will use various conventions,0.0

Levellers In the section LevellersOrigin_of_name there is the following text It first appeared in print in a book written by Charles I called His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration first sold around 15 November 1647 On the 11th of November 1647 the King Charles R send a message to the Speaker of the House of Lords in which he talks about the Levellers this is a letter in which he states that he is forced to flee from Hampton Court The King arrived on the Isle of Wight on the 14th and stays with the Governor Robert Hammond And as the King was effectively being held a prisoner by Colonel HammondCharles_I_of_EnglandEnglish_Civil_war long after the 16th  Which made me wonder who started selling the book and whether the book was sold despite or because of the tumult As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War which ended May of 1646 and the Second English Civil War Naturally at the time His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War but it might be considered slightly inflammatory And although I dont doubt the book is genuine it is plain that Charles I had little to do with the sale as he was on the Isle of Wight    Michael van der Vlis Ive been modifying Michael van der Vlis,0.0

added in parallel to Vankys reply above  Well thats driven me back to read the 1976 postscript  its a good read  where the following apologia looks relevant    it is true that in 1955 I allowed some hectoring political moralisms as well as a few Stalinist pieties to intrude upon the text I had then a somewhat reverent notion of Marxism as a received orthodoxy The book was published at the height of the Cold War Intellectual McCarthyism was not confined to the US The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the nonSocialist press This welcome was mainly silence broken by the review in TLS headed Morris  Marxism  So yes the _1955_ edition was coolly received in EPTs opinion largely because of his unfashionable Marxist viewpoint But in 76 when The Making of the English Working Class was in its 5th Penguin reprint things had moved on,0.0

The reason the PS2 lacks AA is because AA requires processing power If the PS2 were to attempt to render any of its higherend games with added AA its framerate would keel over and die I further believe you have no idea what you are talking about because you claim AA does not make digitally rendered images look better The following chart is borrowed from the AAs wikipedia page  width300 alignright stylemarginleft5px a b c   Figure 1     a is no AA b is with AA and c is with a different AA If you honestly believe b or c are in some way blurry then I agree you are entitled to your own opinion If you do not find b and c to be blurry at all but less Jagged then you realize the importance of this effect You would then realize that AA does not cause your video quality to be blurry but it is more likely that your TV is causing the blurryness I know this because TVs are already too blurry for my personal preference The PS2 does not actually need AA It is not ment for use with an HD TV However if you were to use a PS2 with an HD TV you would realize the presence of massive jaggies in comparison to the xboxs picture quality Just incase you did not know you compare screenshots by seeing how they would look on the highest quality screen prefferedly the same screen unit You do not compare them by putting them on an old tv from the 1980s A 1980s TV would make the PS2s graphics look far more competitive with the xboxs graphics However an HD TV would not I have not  made any false statements as far as I know I assume that was directed at the AA bust The reason I said the PS2 lacked AA is not because it could not do it but because it does not do it That last statement is sort of like saying a low end Dell computer is more powerful than a super computer because it has sold 100x as many units This is not about grabbing ilrelevent facts such as sales to divert the fact that youre wrong and cant prove otherwise this is about how the xbox is more powerful than the PS2 and the screenshots are clear evidence I never said PS2 is more powerful is what you said Xbox is not more powerful then PS2 is the arguement The architectures being different does not make it unfair to compare them You can easily compare them with performance tests The xbox excels farther at its target goal than the PS2 therefor it is more powerful Is there an arguement to that Does the PS2s 62 GFLOPS relative to the xboxs 29 GFLOPS suddenly make the PS2 more powerful Does a meaningless benchmark magicly make the PS2 better at doing something that the xbox is actually better at doing No it does not The xbox consistantly exhibits better performance therefor it is nothing but logical to say it is more powerful,0.0

The above paragraph illustrates that the axis to this entire debate is your misunderstanding of WPSELF More specifically your mistaken definition of reference WPSELF seeks to avoid encyclopediac references This means that all the facts of all articles come from the source and never from another article The reason for this is clear You however choose to define reference very liberally and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia which of course is silly  Somehow youve come to believe you are the last word on what is and is not relevant despite press coverage and vast consensus to the contrary McCarthyism is alive and well on Wikipedia Whats funny is these little witch hunts for irrelevance are so restricted in scope and totally arbitrary in their focus Do us a favor and go take your fervor over to Christina Aguilera,0.0

Are all of these references really noncanonical Does a reference to a noncanonical book exist just because there is similar language  Some of Pauls socalled references seem to be little more than his borrowing of a turn of phrase  In at least one case a supposedly noncanonical source seems canonical to me  Chronicles refers to a book of Samuel the seer describing the deeds of King David  Last I checked there was a book in the bible accredited to Samuel who was a seer and that book was largely about the deeds of King David  That got me wondering whether the book of Kings like Chronicles and Samuel usually published as two books in most modern bibles records any of the other writings referenced in Chronicles,0.0

WTF are you an idiot No really what is your IQ I only ask because there is tons of information out there that is peer reviewed and is telling us the opposite of what your alleging then to support your claim you find a nonpeer reviewed source the only one i found that actually states anything like what u are suggesting that you then refute Really is this what wikipedia is coming to We should have an IQ test before u sign up and edit Get some facts and some references and then make your stupid claims No animal ever has a 100 success rate in hunting or anything else for that matter even a 6th grader could tell you that,1.0

WikipediaIndian wikipedians notice board Hi I would like you to be an active member of WikipediaIndian wikipedians notice board,0.0
What I dislike about your proposed version is that it doesnt carry the forms  aspects distinction which was the point of my proposal I think its extremely important to have this distinction in mind a If were going to keep political liberalism in there we need to call it an aspect because no liberal objects to whats been called political liberalism here so it doesnt exactly make sense to call it a form of liberalism which people argue over b The reason I insist on this is that modern political ideologies borrow certain aspects of liberal thought and then abandon others The aspects division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind The perfect example is that of social conservatives who can be economically liberal without being socially liberal In any case if the formsaspects division is tossed then Id rather that those sections called cultural and political liberalism also be removed or placed in a different section since they already describe essential  noncontroversial issues within liberalism IIRC The only paragraph I ommitted was the last one about modernday liberalismlip service since it was already discussed earlier in the section and seemed out of place given the topic of this section The other sections were shuffled around to one place or another,0.0

Lead of article   According to WPLEADThe lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview It should define the topic establish context explain why the topic is notable and summarize the most important pointsincluding any prominent controversies The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic according to reliable published sources and the notability of the articles subject is usually established in the first few sentences Apart from trivial basic facts significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article This articles lead does not follow those guidelines The lead should refer to the accepted theory that Mark was used as a source of both Matthew and Luke and briefly discuss the very prominent controversy surrounding the end of the Gospel It should not refer to  an understanding of 1st century GrecoRoman culture regarding oral tradition or  prePauline beliefs because those concepts are not covered in the remainder of the article The guidelines also state the lead should be written in a clear accessible style which the last paragraph is not Once again I will leave this for a day or so to see if anyone comments before I try to change anything,0.0

Question concering RFA votes    As you have not answered my question that I asked you on Downloads RFA and before you show me that subpage I already read it so there is no need  Secondly do not quote policy on me and evade simply answer the questions please   1How many more active admins do we have now then we did at the time you nominated Child of Midnight for adminship I nominated him because he asked for it I probably would have opposed if he actually accepted it but he didnt I do not care about activeinactive admins I am only concerned with goodbad admins Remove all the bad admins and then start nominating good admins    2Please explain your ideal active admintoarticle ratio The number of admins is fine there are just too many bad admins that hurt the project more than they help it Again there could be 20000 admins and I would be fine with that but there must be no BAD admin If all 20000 were active or inactive I wouldnt care as long as they were good and followed policy The current 1000 has many bad administrators this is why there are too many I would be fine with 500 or 5000 admins as long as they are all good As soon as an admin blocks some maliciously or deletes something that wasnt within policy  he should be desysoped by policy without a vote   Ive always seen you vote in oppose and while you are indeed entitled to your own opinion I would like to understand what you view as a good admin  bad admin I find it hard to believe one should assume bad faith in that all potential admin candidates  are considered bad Could you please explain your criteria for what makes a good admin in your opinion   I also wish to still know what your desired admintoarticle ratio is and why if you think an admin is bad dont you just say that instead of answering with      That is all since you put great thought into your votes Im pretty sure you should be able to answer these questions with absolutely no problem whatsoever  Than you for your time      Something to take note of    Hi DougsTech I just wanted to make you aware of a bit of information regarding your RfA voting pattern In the past you have claimed multiple times that youre not violating any policiesguidelines with your RfA votes but you seem to be in violation of WPAGF You are obviously not assuming good faith when you oppose every admin hopeful you see If you think someone will be a bad admin you need to provide a reason specific to that candidate otherwise youre assuming bad faith which is contradictory to the principles on which Wikipedia was founded and on which it still operates review me  No hes not    Someone else can has already found their flaw and the other that oppose the candidate give reasons why heshe is a bad admin    That doesnt excuse you not to give a reason though      Hey Ive got an idea Start a thread about this at WTRFA Otherwise accept that he has his reasons they are good and have been thoroughly explained multiple times Stop harassing him over it    DougsTech nicely done on the cats  Funny    UTC,0.0

An inprint or rather in press article is not a reliable source  It has to be published and referenceable where others can get a hold of it  The errors in the abstract of the online version shows that it is obviously a prepublication version and cant count  By the way not even the TOC for the April issue of CASWJ has been revealed so we just have your word for it that it is appearing at all  The New Developments book is so new that no libraries yet have it but a look at the TOC online as well as the article title it looks like it is a review article not a report of original research  So if you are hanging your hat on this references well the best that can be said is that jury is still out and DDP is still not been subjected to the judgment of the scientific community  We can revisit this when the CASJW article is actually published Until then we cannot say that DDP is evidencebased much less that is accepted by the scientific community  Of course you may have other evidence but you have yet to cite any,0.0

SPL vs SWL   As the article starts out mentioning SPL means Sound Pressure Level whereas Sound Power Level is abbreviated SWL So correct me if Im wrong but when speaker manufacturers mention 93 dB SPL 1W1m are they not referring to Sound Pressure Level In that case this section should be in the Sound pressure article which details SPL instead of this,0.0

EDIT The statement can be removed just on the basis that it adds no value to the article by making it even more biased towards enabling the Holocaust all over wikipedia It assumes that  Leuchter doesnt know the amounts of cyanide needed to kill and it assumes that Leuchter tried to disprove the gas chambers through ignoring the facts Both of these without any proof that thats actually the case   Also even if that was the case  what does tended to confirm it mean Even safe amounts of gas found by any interested parties would tend to confirm that gassings took place so its irrelevant  In general the whole article is focused on disproving the Leuchter report instead of displaying the Leutcher report  thats why it needs to be rewritten,0.0

Two things about that One is that before worrying about the lead we should finish the discussion of naming in the body of the article The place to do that would be the Name change section Currently we have a lot of sources speculating on what would replace Metro Now in retrospect we know Second we should keep the design language separate from what is produced with the design language the UI IMO Metro design language is fine as the article title Its the historical name that everyone knew If anything  Microsoft design language would seem to be the strongest candidate to replace it But this is different from all of the different official and unofficial names for the UI that users see which tend to be tied to the products  Zune UI Windows Store apps etc,0.0
The Harpers magazine article you list and also called well written contains the phrase Post American in the subtitle and article content an obvious bias Time is no exception to bias Every city demolishes structures so its not notable One of the authors you list for example has controversies cited on Wikipedia for misreporting hardly a good source  The stacking of sources with the slant indicated shows merely they are not neutral and contain much bias They amount to WPFancruft and WPCoatrack  Wikipedia is not obligated to include editorial bias Detroit takes in plenty its 11 billion budget with higher population density and higher spending per person than Atlanta show for example that weasel words like decline and others inserted are inappropriate An emergency manager is in place to alleviate largess caused in part by public sector union contracts  it shows responsible action by the governor The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it The city of Detroits home owner vacancy rate is 29 in line with the national average  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s The city has seen multi  billions in revitalization and it continues the city serves an entertainment hub has state of the art facilities state of the art schools a major university casino resorts a world class corporate center a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations  modern freeways etc is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past  Thus the portrayal and description as well as the title of the section are completely inappropriate and not encyclopedic,0.0

Horrendous Inaccuracies   I think there should be something in this article about how inaccurate conservapedia is Just look at their article on England England    Its just nonsense  Wales and Cornwall were independent Pictish kingdoms under Roman rule  The Picts were from Scotland Wales and Cornwall not to mention England didnt even exist until after the Romans left all of modern day England Wales and Cornwall were under Roman rule I wouldnt even say I had a great knowledge of history but I know that much  If anyone had any other examples of ludicrous inacurracies in these sort of articles ie not related to evolutin religion other typical conservative bugbears could you post them here along with any citations from newspapers or blogs pointing out inaccuracies We should think about starting on a new section,0.0

Whoops youre right I was looking closely  Your T is the equivalent to the operator for the 1d quantum harmonic oscillator which means that its eigenfunctions are Hermite functions which are the same as the eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform and the eigenvalues are right too up to a scale factor which I havent looked closely enough to check  So yes it does indeed look like this might give the FRFT  This does seem like a nice way of doing it If it works like it appears to I would be surprised if it werent known since the FRFT is often defined precisely by looking at Hermite functions and the connection of Hermite functions to the harmonicoscillator eigenproblem is well known  However we would have to dig up a clear reference before we could put it into the article,0.0

Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away  That is why I support the idea of including Jewish at the beginning of that subsection of the article  It is not to single out Pilz because he is jewish per se it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the ongoing Zionst smear campaign against Iran   Pilz early anouncements  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his extraordinarily reliable Agent D report  So no matter which candidate won he would have smeared the winner   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins like most people expected so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani  As an Iranian I also feel this is coordinated It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins which so far have turned out to be false without even a cursory investigation How could for example AP Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time And it wasnt even on just one allegation it was on multiple  So multiple News Agencies making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do all at the same time  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other antiIran smear reports  Also you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their proZionist stance  I dont think that is accidental either they are voluntary contributors to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism  The same people also have an interest on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iranrelated articles,0.0

Hi Osorin I deleted the article because it didnt assert why the web service is notable There is a bunch of things I can link you to where you can read more for example mainly WPA7 an WPWEB but also pay attention to WPN and if you are somehow related to the company that supplies the service WPCOI The best way to demonstrate notability is by showing there exist independent reliable sources that provide significant coverage on the subject Every part of that phrase matters so the sources have to be independent of the subject they have to be reliable sources according to Wikipedia standards the main part of that is there has to be editorial review of the sources see WPRS and they have to be about Teamness itself not just mention it I myself presumed there were none because the article didnt state why it is important so that there would be sources about it but I always love to be proven wrong on this See also WPWMD,0.0

Crime first of all you need to monitor that Lanicoya that just because she is from Nicaragua tries to take advantage of that to try to keep sections from being created managua is a dangerous city and wether she like it or not it needs a crime section like san jose costa rica has one and like san salvador el salvador has one Nicaragua Managua is not a safe city okay i had copy the article word by word and it now has been chaged okay here it is  The Regional Security Office US Embassy in Managua reported these incidents   Crime in Nicaragua is in high rise and the National Police does not have the resources to combat it Crime in Managua has had a steady growth throughout the years Managua the capital of Nicaragua is exceptionally extremely dangerous specially at night street crime is very common Majority of the violent crime that is on the rise is due to the countries extreme poverty and lack of jobs The following incidents took place in March and April of this year 2007     Hotel Robberies   On March 29 an American couple visited the city of Granada where they where robbed at gunpoint in their rental home Several days before the couple was robbed they contacted the management about a missing light in the unit At 1130 am on the day of the robbery a Nicaraguan male in his late 20s the suspect was at the front gate of the property he said that he was there to fix the light The victim walked the individual inside the home where he inspected the light The victim then walked the suspect outside so he could get his tools As they got near the front door the suspect stopped and pulled out what the victim described was a 25 caliber or similar to the type automatic pistol and demanded the American couple give him all their money The suspect took the victims wallet took all of the cash and then at the victims request his wallet was returned holding only his identification The suspect then departed the area on foot    On April 4 seventeen members of a US missionary group were robbed at gunpoint while having dinner at their hotel in Managua The US missionary group was given housing at a locallyowned hotel located in a area not frequented by tourists Four Nicaraguan males including two armed with handguns entered the dining room and took the groups cell phones and all their money Two of the suspects walked the members of the US missionary group to their hotel rooms where they stole their digital cameras additional cash and iPods The robbery lasted one hour a hotel employee was able to get away and called the Nicaraguan National Police NNP The Nicaraguan National Police did not arrive however until after the suspects had left the scene None of the victims were badly hurt    The Regional Security Office US Embassy in Managua strongly recommends all visitors and tourists to Nicaragua utilize hotels and guest houses that have a front desk security or concierge that is staffed 24 hours a day fulltime uniformed security access control precautions a fenced perimeter and a well lit and patrolled parking area and rooms equipped with safes for valuables and travel documents       Vehicular BreakIns  In the early afternoon on April 21 a vehicle belonging to an American organization was broken into at a gas station in Managua The vehicle had stopped at the gas station on Carretera Sur South Highway about two miles from the US Embassy in Managua When leaving the car to make purchases in the station store a young Nicaraguan male approached the driver and said hed watch the vehicle for money The driver accepted this offer and the cars passengers entered the gas station When leaving the gas station they found that the young Nicaraguan male who had offered to watch the car was already gone and they noticed that the rear passenger door window had been broken A briefcase that held files and their identification documents where also taken from the rear seat The young male who had offered to watch the car returned to the scene The NNP took him in to further investigate the case but were unable to confirm his direct involvement in the crime    The Regional Security Office US Embassy Managua recommends that travelers do not leave valuables where they can be seen in parked cars and when possible park in a location where the vehicle can be monitored or where they have cameras   Estancia de Santo Domingo   Shortly after sunrise on April 5 a Managua Nicaragua r,0.0

Move request   I know there has been a section on that but lets request a move to Meran again The city belongs to South Tyrol and the language of the autonomous province of South Tyrol is German despite its belonging to the state of Italy  just as Québecs language is French despite its belonging to the state of Canada This one here even happens to have a Germanspeaking majority If Im rightly informed the Ladin name is Meran too I dont even see where there could be a possible discussion  That is unless Merano would be the established English name as Cologne is for Köln In that case its the English wikipedia But while I dont really know I dont think this is the case And in that case its not the Italian wikipedia,0.0

Irving quote   Re Authoritive statements of Irving in Battle of Britain article  You have rewrote the section as following  Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels with 250 singleengined and 64 twinengined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974 p 163 and that as a result the number of German front line aircraft were declining and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942 with a huge effort to expand production reaching 1200 by MarchApril 1942Irving 1974 p 142  In fact however Irving does not make these statements If you read the book  which has been linked in free pdf format here is what he writes on page 163  On Milchs desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too To him air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month Fighter production had averaged  single and  twinengined aircraft a month during  Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well⁴⁰  etc  Ie Irving does not state totally inadequate production levels and even less mentions bombers this is the addition of one editor to the Irving book which has been described as Milchs diary which is it not either,0.0

You did a great job on all your maps I salute you Speaking of which would you happen to have a map of Monmouth County with all township boarders Im a resident of Marlboro Township Thanks  Monmouth County may be the one county with the most number of small incorporated municipalities and it makes it difficult to show all the legal borders  The townships could be shown easily but there are 20 or more small boroughs along the coast that hardly show at all  I could add an outline map to the county page if it would be helpful but it would be hard to label everything     I added an index map to the Monmouth County New Jersey page  Take a look and see what you think    Feedback I think its great Keep up the good work  Chris   Map data   Hi Jim I saw your recent uploads of ImageAndover boro njjpg and ImageAndover twp njjpg and I was wondering where the map data came from and what tools you used to put it together  Id like to make similar maps for other areas  Thanks    The software was Manifold the data was from multiple sources  The administrative boundaries and water features were from the Census Bureaus 2004 TigerLine second edition files for Sussex County the road network was from the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the place names and locations were from the USGS Geographic Name Information Service files  I used information from the TigerLine files to identify the divided highways  The New Jersey state outline was from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2004 National Transporation Atlas Databases state boundary file   Interesting but I think Manifold may be out of my price range  Thanks for your contribtions these are quite complex maps compiled from several public domain sources good work  BTW is it possible to upload PNG or SVG output from Manifest  The current JPEGs have compression artifacts as JPEG was intended for photos not solidcolorregion graphical data  See WikipediaPreparing images for upload  Thanks      Thanks I changed all the maps to PNG files      Thanks for the maps  Hi Jim I also appreciated your maps for Sussex County and the ones that seem to be appearing as I type for Passaic County I have been part of a small group working on Wikiproject New Jersey a project aimed at filling in the holes and expanding the details regarding New Jersey in all its aspects While there are portions of the state covered by your maps and those ChrisRuvolo has created we could definitely use maps for all of the 566 municipalities in the state plus the CDPs and unincorporated areas if possible Any assistance that you could provide in creating and uploading maps or in providing guidance in their creation would be most appreciated We could divvy up the map creation work so that we can ensure that the whole state is covered and not just by one or two people    I think the maps are great and I see that Warren County is underway My only question is that on some of the maps particularly for smaller municipalities eg Belvidere New Jersey it can be hard to distinguish between the highlighted municipality and the rest of the county Is there any way to change the colors to improve the contrast Other than that keep up the great work    Some of the smallest places do get lost  The larger red label was an attempt to highlight the principle location on each map but at the scale of the map there isnt much to be done for the small places  I started out mostly interested in showing the township outlines since most of the online street map servers dont show township outlines  Once I have a county set up it is relatively easy to produce an entire set of maps all at the same scale but it would be much more work to change the scale or colors for individual towns  Maybe there will be time to revisit the smaller places later on      CDP maps in New Jersey  I wanted to thank you for your work on maps of New Jerseys censusdesignated places,0.0

Adminship is not a lifelong appointment Any admin can be revoked if he does things that are not appropriate for an admin to do For example you misinterpreting my freedom of speech as being incivil is not an appropriate thing for an admin to do You threatening to block me for reminding you of your mortality is a VERY inappropriate thing for an admin to do Your statements regarding the WikiProject Hawaii Manual of Style are WAY OFF You need to take a truth pill man There is no violation in editing an article when it specifically invites users to edit it Have you even looked at it Its not even an article Its a mere stub Its history page had only one entry before I contributed Nobody has touched that stub in over 7 months You said I changed it completely Thats FALSE Making FALSE statements is a VERY inappropriate thing for an admin to do I did NOTHING that goes against the manual of style that was there There is NOTHING there that says dont make changes There is NOTHING at WikiProject Hawaii requiring a survey There has been NO TALK AT ALL on that MoS since the STUB was created Its been DEAD with NO CONTRIBUTIONS and NO USER INTEREST for over 7 months And now you criticize me for participating as a member of the Wikipedia community and as an expert on the Hawaiian language for making a positive contribution and bringing some LIFE to a dead neglected stub You need to review what Wikipedia is about Its not about treating admins as a superior race Admins are subject to the same rules as users Even the President of the USA is just a man Ryulong,1.0

GA review of Kittis Hognosed Bat   Thank you for your time reviewing the article so far I was hoping you could give your quick input on the following two things I tried expanding the lead a bit but now the problem Im running into is that its hard to summarize each section of the article without simply repeating information that appears later I suppose this is a consequence of the article being short to begin with Any advice Concerning your comment about drifting between singular and plural language Im not sure how to avoid this more than I already have I tried to use singular Kittis Hognosed Bat the bat or it wherever possible but in some cases I felt it was necessary to instead use plural for nouns like colonies and populations  Again thanks for your help,0.0
AntiLove Song   I moved your information from the talk page to the main article It looks shorter now but I kept everything The main reason it is shorter is because phrases like from RavenSymones fourth album RavenSymone just become from the album  This is the right way to handle singles that never charted They dont get an individual article but theres nothing at all wrong  with putting the infobox and description in the album article  We havent been working well together but Id like to try and change that I can see that you are an editor that wants to do things right Unfortunately part of doing things right is to not create articles that fail guidelines The guidelines for article creation on singles are at WPNSONGS which I kept pointing at every time I redirected one of these articles or nominated it for deletion Following guidelines is important and if you do so we should get along much better,0.0

THIS ARTICLE IS AN INSULT TO OBJECTIVITY This article does a very poor job of maintaining an objective stance it is undeniable It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and cosponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003  It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an F rating last Congressional session,1.0

When making precise comparisons between classes of entities it is customary to use precisely defined entities  Set is a precisely defined concept as is program for any specific programming language  In contrast algorithm is a vague term for class of programs that do essentially the same thing  There are many notions of essentially the same thing but the one that is assumed by and is sufficient for the statement of the ChurchTuring thesis is accept the same set of inputs There are various finer notions  One much studied one is based on David Parks notion of bisimulation as strengthened by Milner  Another is based on the distinctions between true concurrency and interleaving concurrency drawn by partialorder and higherdimensional models of computation both of which I have written many papers on between 1980 and the present  Yet another is based on the concept of identification in the limit studied by EM Gold and others in the 1960s and rediscovered independently by Burgin in 1983 under the name inductive Turing machine see M Burgin Inductive Turing machines Notices Acad Sci USSR 270 1983 12891293 All these refinements of the general notion of computational equivalence naturally lead to new computation classes  However none of these new classes impact the ChurchTuring thesis which is formulated for the acceptancebased notion of equivalence  Any discussion of violations of the thesis needs to be conducted in terms of sets the natural semantics that goes with the thesis  Other distinctions drawn by more refined notions of algorithm while of interest in their own right have no bearing on the thesis,0.0

The airship hangar at Tillamook Oregon has about 28000 square meters of floor space making it about a third larger than the Tacoma dome and about ten times the size of the Great Buddha Hall  I believe the airship hangars at Tustin California are of similar dimensions to Tillamook  They stand a thousand feet long nearly 300 feet wide and nearly 200 feet tall and inside its all clear space  They are clearly buildingsthey have roofs and walls and are completely enclosed from the elementsand while they use metal fasteners they are of the sort of construction that most people think of as wooden so I cant think of a reason why one of them should not be listed as the largest wooden building,0.0

Weve mentioned before that putting facts in an article asserts to some extent their notability  Surely doing an entire article about these controversies would be doing so excessively  My suggestion is that we try to strike a reasonable lengthbalance as a crude way of keeping things in perspective As I write this the Controversies section is 1128 words  Background is 477 Recognition is 179 Ideas is 517 Political Career is 455 total 2756 So the Controversies are more than twice as long as any other section and make up 41 of the entire body text Heres just a number Im throwing out  Lets try to bring controversies to 600 words  It would still be the longest section and take up 29 of the body text but it would certainly be much fairer than the present situation,0.0

But in general there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors or between even and odd when it comes to integrands  An example in one dimension when  and  is  The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor or odd tensor density but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher in a higherdimensional example they would be no longer righthanded  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor or even tensor density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order b  a in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining righthandedness  The usual convention Ive seen is to keep the coordinates righthanded and to transform the integrand as a pseudotensor density but the other approach is equally valid,0.0

Hi Great if you improve the English language Kvarstad artcicle with material from the Swedish version I have been aware of the Swedish article for quite a while and notice that you did a good job in translatingadapting this article into Norwegian I only noticed one obvious error in the numbers that is the sentences Lägren hade då totalt 382 besättningsmedlemmar från kvarstadsbåtarna and Leiren hadde da totalt 382 besetningsmedlemmer fra kvarstadbåtene where the number 382 conflicts with other numbers given It is correct that the cited source gives this number but it has to be either a misprint or meant to include more The book  gives a good overview of the number of prisoners and what happened to them Apart from that I think that most of the ships should also have their own articles as the Kvarstad article covers only a few days of their total lifespans,0.0

My comments were concerned with the people who claimed it should be deleted altogether  Regarding those people i think they are not being helpful  At FFMG I attempted to address your concerns The section is now not only about one campaign and I removed the see also section The agendas of 26 parties have to do with policies and political personalities  An election boycott has to do with the general election itself  That is why it is relevant  Also your 77 turnout figure regards people who registered and did not vote  You should also take into account the number of people of voting age who did not register  Most of the people who boycotted were likely to have decided to boycott before registration even took place  There are about 7 million people who did not even register   Finally the relevence of the boycott relates to specific communities boycotting  While figures are not out yet as such I am sure after figures do come in there will be communities where 80 or 90 of the people of voting age did not vote  Regarding Zains comments I maintain that theory regardless of whether it is scientific or social theory can be considered a fringe theory  But we are not talking about theories here  We are talking about events  This event did happen  Theres nothing theoretical about it After your comments i do agree that the last sentence is not so important and might as well be removed I fail to see how it is possible to shorten the second to last sentence without removing relevant list of some of the organisations that are boycotting  I hope that my comments and edits are received in good faith,0.0

response I was the one to use the word I dont see how its use can be a violation of WPPOV as all instances of exterior design reuse are cited I am saying I didnt think they copied someone else thought they copied and I am registering it My small dictionary says the meaning of the word ape is to imitate the behavior or manner of especially in an absurd or unthinkable way In this instance BYD Auto has imitated the manner of cars belong to other carmaker and in a way unthinkable by most Japanese European American or Korean carmakers  Other words that could have been used are copy to make something to be similar or identical to another  this is a more apt term but for stylistic reasons is not to be overused in the passage that is dont use the same word twice emulate match or surpass typically by imitation  not applicable imitate take or follow as a modelcopy or simulate  not applicable because the cars copy too closely the exterior design of those other cars This is why the word resemble is NA too The cars do not imitate or resemble they are the exterior designs of other carmakers They dont take a design cue here and there they take an entire front fascia  mimic NA because it has connotations of copying in order to annoy that which is being copied,0.0

suck it asshats  Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link  Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warmings alleged impact on hurricanes  The computer models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us said Emanuel whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear  He told the New York Times There are various interpretations possible The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing Hard to know which to believe yet  In 2005 a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming  His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate said Marc Morano a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen James Inhofe ROkla  First 2007 turned out to be the tipping point for global warming fears and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views more and more skeptical scientists speak out and new data debunks manmade climate fears  Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of manmade climate fears,1.0

Kindly stop vandalising   What you had done repeatedly with family names Alempijević et al is vandalising As per CategoryRedirects_from_surnames redirect MAY be used if there is only one person with that surname but only if she is well known under the surname alone And even then it does NOT HAVE to be used In the case of football players they are certainly not famous enough and neither is some minor politician being tried to be considered an exclusive representative of the surname  Family name is a separate entry from these individual people Family names in various languages do have separate entries Maybe the article about Ćesarević and Alempijević needs expounding to be a decent article on a family name but it most certainly does not need to be vandalised with effacing it and redirecting it is a valid entry as such,0.0

Crown corporations  VIA Rail is a not a true Crown Corporation in that it cannot raise funds on the money market rather it is subject to the whims of the government of the day for its ongoing funding This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot  True enough regarding how political control limits the companys viability pun intended however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canadas history has been fairly broad  In the sense that any publicly owned ie government company in Canada is a Crown corporation then VIA Rail would meet that criteria  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970s and the Canadian railway industrys deregulation in the 1980s CN was not allowed to raise funds either  Provincial Crown corporations like BC Rail and BC Ferries or NB Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence  I could be wrong as I have not read the VIA Rail Act indepth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the money market in the way you describe  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th21st century measure this  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nations highways each day or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIAAmtraketc or the environmental benefits realized etc etc etc then VIA Rail Amtrak Eurorail various ferries etc will never be financially solvent  Cheers     The following section was added by  and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors  Officially the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line However this move was seen as somewhat more politicallymotivated by some Coincidentally the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative Harvey André the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990 was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life The CN line also went through Edmonton the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark  No doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts however Im unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continentals route historically the Super was a CN transcontinental train and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental they decided to keep the morerecognized Canadian brand and use it on the CN line why the CN line is the question however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees insurance costs etc etc  Politics could also have played a role or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the TransCanada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already wellserved by intercity busses  The main reason Ive commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark  Mulroneys ridings  Clark represented High River near Calgary Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau Quebec  Harvey André  I have no idea  very likely though  Once this part gets editedverified properly it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990   Joe Clark was born and raised in High River but he represented Yellowhead a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper from 1979 to 1993 Mulroney never lived in Alberta nor was he ever an Alberta MP   Locomotive roster  The roster is a dogs breakfast of past and present with nothing to distinguish between Use of streamline to describe ex CPR Budd built stainless steel equipment is a questionable term This whole section needs some serious work     Yeah this is definitely a mess  Before I put some time in cleaning it up would anyone like to weigh in as to whether theyd like to see this sort of information in this article  For Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway weve resisted having the roster in the article but VIA Rail might be different because a its locomotive count is in the dozens not the thousands and b its a bit easier to compile a complete roster since VIAs under 30 years old  Im ki,0.0

VfD on Jews by country   This has not yet been submitted and John would wig out if I submitted it myself But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country And finally the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries  As an example being Australian I checked his figure for Australian Jews in his words None of his references give his figure of 100452 Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy In fact checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84000 people who marked Judaism as their religion That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author,0.0

No sir this comment is disgusting  You offer not one scintilla of evidence for the claims you make nor do you site one example of factual error in the article  All you have to offer are your recycled opinions about the Irish Republican movement  You have nothing new or even interesting to say  I always love it when armchair opponents of the IRA jump up on their high horse and begin pontificating because almost without exception they say something like this Whatever the crimes of the British government as though it is reasonable and proper to dismiss 800 years of oppression murder starvation and constant meddling on the part of the Brits so that one may then attack the excesses of the Republicans who have been fighting to kick the Brits out  Lets see 800 years of oppression on the part of the Brits vs the just over 80 years that the IRA has existed and you in all of your wisdom decide that the RA is worse  Go pound your chest elsewhere,1.0

Joe Wilson was the founder of the 1734 Witchcraft tradition and was a very notable significant and influential figure in Traditional Witchcraft circles He is mentioned in Ronald Huttons Triumph of the Moon from memory Id need to check that and he has been discussed in several books by Evan John Jones and I believe Nigel Pennick I dont have these references in front of me but since the threat of deletion is hanging over this article I wanted to get my word in before anyone gets too excited For a little historical overview Roy Bowers and his Clan of Tubal Cain represented the strongest early competition to Wicca for the claim to being a genuine surviving tradition of witchcraft rather than a 20th century invention Roy Bowers writing under the name Robert Cochrane became one of the most famous and controversial figures in British witchcraft circles and indeed stirred up a lot of controversy on purpose Little was known at first of Bowers philosophy or magic and he died at a young age however Joe Wilson had conducted a series of correspondence with him through which he and subsequently the rest of the witchcraft community were given insights into Bowers system These letters are quite famous amongst witches as is the 1734 Tradition thats not a date that Wilson established based on Bowers teachings I have tried to wikilink to 1734 Tradition in the past and been surprised and dismayed that neither this tradition nor Joe Wilson had articles yet finally someones making a start Very notable in his field,0.0

Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy  Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement  Any choice of target redistributes from some groups to others  making some worse off For example high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt  including pensioneers holders of fixed income securities employees with protected jobs and annuitylike compensation including most government employees and policy makers and most tenured academics and creditors  It benefits net debtors  particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest rate caps  It also benefits owners of commodities real estate foreign currencies equity in export oriented firms local employees in trade sensitive and offshoringcapable sectors and the unemployed  Low inflation benefits holders of fixed rate debt business that export to the target country importers employees who gain from offshoring retired people on fixed pensions and people with protected annuity like wages academics government employees and policy makers  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers  increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets and transfers wealth away from debtors owners of real estate owners of commodities local import sensitive businesses and the insecurely employed  In theory this could be corrected  restoring its neutrality and Pareto improvement however transaction costs moral hazard information asymmetry and political  resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical  To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer of wealth between a priori known counterparties it is not a neutral economic tool  and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies  Furthermore such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy targets  rentierscreditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy  debtors will prefer looser monetary policy as will exporters and other participants in internationallytradeable sectors of the economy owners of commodities   and real estate and the precariously employed  If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within and between trading nations some monetary policy targets may also move an economy away from an efficient frontier  Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents   From a principal agent perspective monetary policy makers face  a personal moral hazard  since their compensation typically takes the form of a secure fixed annuity  This would incentivize them to favor tight monetary policy  even at the expense of lower real GDP growth Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly loose monetary policy  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth  contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their overall moral hazard,0.0

Dougies been warned about Canvassing but still insists on doing it  Hes been running around all over about this but heres a new twist  What if the rumors are correct We know Passions is ending within months and the rumors are happy endings all around including Theresa and Ethan At that point CRANE wont be her name  Why bounce the article every where when the show is within months from ending  A womans maiden name is always her name  If she ends up marrying Ethan her name will change again  This resistance to leave her as her maiden name is just silly  On soaps women change their names all the time but the MAJORITY of articles stay at the maiden name  This is one of a very few with a minority insisting on moving when majority says dont,0.0

A reference that may interest you   Hello Zleitzen  Your boldness in restoring the integrity of the CG article is greatly appreciated I have been searching for the references we discussed re CubaUSSR relations and have just found an interesting paragraph on page 361 of Ernesto Guevara también conocido como el Che 2003 edition by Paco Ignacio Taibo II that I am wondering if you have seen  I believe that there is too much text for me to reproduce it here without violating WPs copyright rules but I am thinking that perhaps you either own or have access to that book Meanwhile I will be searching for the other references that I promised to forward to you Am hoping you will continue to keep a watchful eye on the CG article Many thanks,0.0

User Jayjgs revert war at Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel  This is not a formal complaint but I would like to informally draw the attention of some members of the arbitration committee to the behavior of user Jayjg an arbitration committee member at Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel and its talk page  There is a dispute about the inclusion of a description of a translating group  Jayjg has removed the description I added on 1012 May 8 2006 1019 May 7 2006 2319 May 5 2006 Jayjg and other times  While the article is not heavily edited there is certainly no consensus that the description should be removed nor has Jayjg supported his reasoning for removing it after being challenged to do so by myself and another editor  I think that as a member of the arbitration committee Jayjg should be held to an even higher standard than atlarge editors,0.0

Lionelt I strongly agree that we need to be mindful of WPWEIGHT when it comes to Boswell Ive argued this for years as you can see in the archived discussions However considering how much traction Boswells idea has gotten  virtually every work on Sergius and Bacchus that has been printed since discusses it very often criticizing it  it does need a brief neutral mention here I believe that the stable version of the article did that  it indicated what Boswell said regarding Sergius and Bacchus and then noted specifically that other historians have criticized his methodology and interpretations There is no need for a pointbypoint evaluation of all claims Boswell makes regarding Sergius and Bacchus additionally not all those claims are disputed for instance that Sergius and Bacchus were the most popular example of paired saints Indeed WPFRINGE specifically says not to do this It is enough to indicate that many other historians have rejected it,0.0

Sample of bona fide sources demonstrating or referring to official US recognition of Scientology as a religion   Here is how the New York Times commented on the 1993 tax exemption   The landmark reversal shocked tax experts and saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes More significantly the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in Scientologys worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion On the basis of the IRS ruling the State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists The German Government regards the organization as a business not a taxexempt religion the very position maintained for 25 years by the American Government   I think the NY Times writer clearly expresses the view here that the US abandoned their earlier view of Scientology as a business as still espoused today by Germany   Note that the State Department Report referred to in the NY Times article is the Religious Freedom Report The Religious Freedom Reports for Germany have discussed discrimination against Scientologists by the German state almost every year since the IRS decision referring in 2006 for example to certain religious minorities notably Scientologists   Following the 1993 IRS decision the IRS wrote to foreign governments appending a document entitled Description of the Scientology Religion to their letter and stating that various Scientology organizations had demonstrated that they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private individual   Media references to the Scientology religion and similar references to Scientology as a religion are common   The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties says that Despite its legal setbacks Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States   As for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the United States to determine what is or is not a religion the United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit stated in a 1992 decision that Indeed the IRS itself has stipulated in other cases that the Church of Scientology is a bona fide religion so in the view of that court at least the IRS has been quite capable of making such stipulations   The St Petersburg Times wrote in 1998 that After a 40year battle the IRS dropped its tax dispute with Scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in 1993   Such sources cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand as Scientologist misrepresentation,0.0

Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources   On I posted a section on Talk Death of Adolf Hitler titled Random Questions which started I am not a scholar I read Wiki but would not think of editing it But I was disappointed in this article and many points in the discussion so I am asking some questions Perhaps someone else will read and address them The section went on with several rethoritical questions and ended with As to sources the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas sort of shaky and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler English translation I buy much of this  Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator because at  she replied with As the article lead saysThis said this talk page isnt a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic its meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text I say this because the article seems to already cover with thorough citations most if not all of what youve brought updodgy Gwen Gale talk  By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler who I have just referenced and thinks that I am asking a personal question not a rhetorical one At that time I apologized tried to explain myself and restate my questions  At  I posted If I had read Kershaws Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldnt have wasted your time You cant get much clearer than that Should be required reading Perhaps someone else should read them and possibly edit the article Thank you for your time99412515 talk  At  I posted I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler 19391945 Nemesis ISBN 0393322521 Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article Please pay attention to his notes and sources Be warned his book Hitler a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resourcesThe source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a Germans analysis of 1950s postSoviet interviews of bunker survivors The original transcripts must be available somewhere There are many other bunker interviews some with questionable intent and not all agree Wm5200 talk  Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article   Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts Was I sometimes rude and argumentative Absolutely Was I making legitimate points which related to the article I thought so Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator I think not but you judge  My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed I repeatedly begged anyone especially Gwen Gale to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw specifically two footnotes I even told the pages of the footnotes Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source   I posted under the heading Question for Gwen Gale  the following I lost you but Im confused myself It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article  My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225000 people with 4 MILLION titles numbers approximate thanks Carol Kershaw Joachimsthaler Thomas TrevorRoper Beevor Shirer Ryan Toland EberleUhl LehmannCarroll ODonnell Victor PetrovaWatson Vinogradov hit a snag reordered These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010 I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources but I think that should be addressed If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion that also should be addressedI know that this is POV and that I am personally involved But I can not help but believe that this article has problems with its processWm5200 talk  On  Gwen Gale posted For starters the Russian autopsy bore overwhelming evidence he not only shot himself but bit down on a cyanide capsule Gwen Gale talk By this post it is clear to anyone familiar with either Joachimsthaler or Kershaw that Gwen Gale is still not familiar with either work Joachimsthaler was first referenced by me at 0127 5 August 2010 and Kershaw was referenced by me at 1748 6 August 2010 and I believe that they were both on t,0.0

Pakistani Shamanism  In the Northern Areas of Pakistanmostly in Hunza Shamans perform or act totaly different than others in the World Shaman mostly provide their services to homes and to public If someone has a problem at home they call a Shaman to recover the truth or kill the evil or help them out of the on going problem A Shaman eates a plant gal or sanoobar in urdu and gets antoxicated and calls his holly spiritts and tells the story to homeowner or recovers the evil and takes it away from the home  When a Shaman has to perform in public or if he has to predict the future of the state or area he dances on a special music rythm called bitan e hareep in Brushaski while on the other hand some people cut a goat and once they cut its off the Shaman takes the head while its bleeding and drinks the blood and calls mamazaro the fairies and predicts the future sajjad hyder 527 am Pakistan Time,0.0

Holy crap Lest someone mistakenly visit a talk page expecting to read some truth and hence be confused reading this gentlemans comment and mistaking the writer for someone who knows what theyre talking about Id just like to point out the above explanation for the word handicap is complete bollocks handicap has meant to place at a disadvantage for a long long time According to Merriam Webster the etymology is Etymology     obsolete English handicap a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap from hand in cap which obviously has nothing at all to do with being Handy with a cap or even related to the disabled Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960s era community welfare practices but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word not the words fault at all,1.0

The following things need to be retained  A fuller quotation of Horowitz that conveys his charges and stated implications to Dees  In fairness and to accomodate NPOV a balancing fuller quotation of Berlet would also be needed  Reference to the allegations by Arabia against Berlets style of argument  eg critique for guilt by association and critique for squashing free speech  Specification of how the dispute actually concluded  not simply see here For example it should be noted that SPLC stood by Berlet and Berlet responded plus Horowitzs counterresponse The fairest way of doing this is again to give both Berlet and Horowitz a representative quote in their own words,0.0

UserTajik vandalizes every page I edit   Hi   I just randomly selected your name from the list to ask if you can help me please Everyday I edit cities of Afghanistan but right away  reverts all my hard work claiming everything I add to the articles is POV or nonsense I have 100 full information on entire Afghanistan and everything I add is also sourced This UserTajik has a serious problem with me over ethnic issues For example I added at the end of Herat article that the city is in control of the new Afghan government along with NATO forces being there assissting the government However UserTajik claims this is nonsense and reverted the page I rather not revert pages but settle the dispute in a nice manner on the talk pagesomething he does not responds to I tried this on Kandahar talk page but did not get any responses from UserTajik I dont know what to do with this UserTajik It is not just one page he reverts but every page I visit The reason for this is that his ethnics are from Tajiks and I am Pashtun He does not trust western sources but relies only on Iranian sources At one time he reverted 3 times in a row and when I reported him to another Administer William M Connolley no action was taken against him I would appreciate it if you could help me stop UserTajik from vandalizing my edits Thank You  1212 November 5 2006,0.0

I notice there is already something cited there However as the document points out the distinction between εκπορεύεσθαι ekporeuesthai and προείναι proeinai was not made in Latin theology which used the same term procedere to denote both realities Is this enough to explain the insistence of the Latin tradition on the Filioque Saint Maximus the Confessor seems to think so For him the Filioque was not heretical because its intention was to denote not the εκπορεύεσθαι ekporeuesthai but the προείναι proeinai of the Spirit But I still believe a more explicit citation should be found or Maximus view should be made more clear,0.0

Were not really discussing whether or not the candidates are notablewere discussing whether their candidacies are And to say that my three criteria are complicated is a bit of a stretch and weve had much more complicated criteria for other reasons what defines potential publicly expressed declined etc candidates for example Finally to say that were making this argument because we have some POV against those candidates is also a stretch Quite frankly I think Vermin Supreme is not only hilarious but also making a very valid observation about our system I greatly admire Ted Williams as well for his life story Basically my opinion of the candidates has no bearing on my argument I think we do need to make a change,0.0

Some Oreo Facebook fans are agen it the bible agen it god agen it and if youve got any sense you agen it Awesome season finale And epic cliffhangerhaha I havent really been keeping up with the anime Ive been watching this season have like 34 episodes per show i havent watched yet but Ive watched every Helvana part thats been released the moment I noticed it was uploaded Act 2 is gonna be EPIC Cant wait to see what happens next lmaoif this lady had given her name shed loose her head by midnight Ana for the win on this I like the videos that go over more general techniquestips as opposed to videos that are a little too specific like how to draw Naruto so this one was a winner for me I dont know if youve covered this already but it would be nice to have a video on bushestreesgardens Drawing everything line by line is absurdly time consuming and Im loosing hair trying to figure out how to conveydraw it another wayThanks for the videos mark  Haha the elf girl looked like she had a thing for Byrd the whole time Ive gotta make sure I have popcorn on hand for Act II  Looking forward to it Were not all monsters in Philly T___T There will always be ignorant people Ana  even if tyt was the most popular show in the world there will always be incredibly ignorant and arrogant jackasses that do stupid shit and manage to get news coverage Before I watched tyt I didnt give a damn about politics since it all seemed so frivolous Now I care more about politics and the direction of our nation as a whole and Im sure Im not the only one Keep fighting the good fight I cant get enough of Byrds expression as he said I Deny Everything Perfect response xDAnd I just realized  its kinda funny how the artists are rich bastards in Helvana when really most artists are broke as hell p I loved Megadethbut now this Im all for Daves music but damn man Just damn ___ This is pretty late but to answer your question  The game seems to only run on 23 CPU threads and the more peopleanimations on screen at once the more CPU gets used CPU handles the frames and animations of objects and models among other things and the more the game bottlenecks on those 23 CPU coresthreads the less your video card has to work withapply textures to Also your GPU gets used more with AA because its denoising whatever frames its rendering This is common in MMOs  I didnt even know you continued filming without the mods man That and real life responsibilities must have been tough  good call going on hiatus If Helvana was becoming a chore then it would have probably started to show in your work anyways plus life responsibilities come first Take it easy and see you around Dan Damn they need to run that in an ad Awesome statement Ha I was about to make the same point Seeing as corporate media panels are usually packed with a bunch of conservatives I dont really see the issue with having an all liberal panel for the point for contrast Though Ill admit that its GREAT to see people like Paul get shot down before the BS plane even takes off on this show Its nice to have a conservative on sometimes to throw a wrench in things This just made my night Ryan is HILLARIOUS Romney just got pwnt What song is this Sounds a lot like touhou arrange music Cenk owned those taki editors SO HARD that I was cringing for the taki editors Im sure theyre in the shower trying to wash off the shame now Of all channels to have FOX NEWS talk about how being detached from reality is dangerous Is it just me or does Rush smack his lips a lot I watch these shows while tabbed into a different window and I swear in almost every video of Rush Ive thought that he was eating something Or not Just learned from reading comments that Rainbow did the original Haha Who needs super computers to direct resources away from environmental sustainability Maybe some humans in another solar system do but we sure as hell dont need any help with that one It seems like a lot of experienced artists tell younger artists that skill and technique isnt as important as we think it is yet art classes are meant to teach and hone skills and technique so I dont quite follow I feel that lots of people have ideas but only a fraction of people with ideas actually have the skill needed to give life to the idea I guess Im trying to ask what your take on the importance of skilltechnique as opposed to imagination or sense of composition is Thanks Ah super late response but thanks for clearing that up Ive been listening to a lot of touhou arranges lately but I dont know the names of all the originals that the arranges are based off of I wouldnt even say that theyre talking about christian freedom They already have christian freedom Theyre talking about christian dominance Let me defend house wives and how theyre persecuted by feminists etc when theyre the greatest thing on earth is what Cenk said It wasnt the clearest thing hes said by any means but it still seems like hes saying housewives are the greatest thing on earth while mocking SE,0.0

Suggestion to add to first paragraph re Fingers role vs Kanes   Im the author of the only bio of Finger and I cant quote myself but hope someone would be willing to add this quotation from Jerry Robinson to the first paragraph  Jerry Robinson said Bill had more to do with the molding of Batman than Bob He just did so many things at the beginningcreating almost all the other charactersthe whole persona the whole temper  It is from page 43 of BILL THE BOY WONDER already cited in article I feel it is the most compelling and authoritative statement explaining how significant Bills role was and Jerry is certainly in a position to make such a statement as he was one of the ghost artists who began on the strip during its debut year He worked closely with both men before National hired him and Finger away from Kane There is considerable misconception about how involved Kane was in the creative aspects of the strip He was not an idea man and in fact did not write a single Batman story in his lifetime  Thank you for considering this,0.0

Power Station Vandalism   I am writing to question you of your suspected involvement in a vandalism attack on a local power station in Reading England We have reason to believe you are the ring leader of a vandal street gang known as the Purple Unity and Red Jacks that are localised to southern Reading On Thursday 21st April 2011 upon the residents of the area witnessing the attack in which seven vandals caused costly damage to the structure and its fences as well as many surrounding trees a cardboard banner was attached to the fence reading Under orders of Gwern  This is not the only occasion in which your Wikipedia account has been referenced On Saturday January 1st 2011 the same gang was seen attempting to transport themselves onto the Madejski Stadium roof using cannons to release a banner over the East Stand reading We will never bow to hatred we will never fall to society we will never rest for fear of our mission failing  All Hail Gwern The initial aim failed they never were able to reach the roof however their banner was slung over a nearby house for all to see  Also on 12th December 2010 a middleaged man was seen sprinting away from elderly people with several teenagers following and aiding him On his shirt he was revealed to be sporting the words Gwern   Now we have strong suspicions that you are this Gwern person and we have every intention of arriving at the truth We will be in contact if we arrive at any more information Thankyou for your time,0.0

The exact quote is Their treatment of Jewish persons was in this sense orthogonal to their guncontrol views Orthogonal according to Wiktionary means independent of or irrelevant to I paraphrased that as unconnected to but Im not wedded to that Having said that what Harcourt acknowledges on page 676 is that the Nazis used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide He then goes on on the following page to say that It is absurd to even try to characterize this as either pro or antigun control italics added In other words their use of the gun laws in this one instance is not their gun control policy I am open to suggestions as to how we express this subtlety,0.0

Possible amicus appeals   I thought this comment might be of interest It indicates that anyone could file an appeal of the block provided the blocked party indicates he wants to appeal it and indicates where he wants the appeal to be made Under the circumstances I think it might be possible that a thread could be opened maybe at ANI requesting the block be lifted or if that proves unsuccessful or doesnt appeal to you requesting some sort of discretionary sanctions on individuals who might seek to prejudicially malign others Under the circumstances I think that there might be a reasonable chance of the block being lifted based on the prejudicial misrepresentation to which you were responding Alternately I think that there might be a very sound basis for requesting that backhanded libellous misrepresentation in the matter of the cword might be made subject to discretionary sanctions on its own   The question of whether you want to appeal is obviously your choice But whether you choose to or not I would be interested in knowing what you might think of maybe requesting discretionary sanctions regarding further misrepresentation  And for what little it might be worth if nothing else I hope you can take advantage of the admittedly unrequested break you are having to maybe enjoy being away from the dramah here for awhile,0.0

Guidance on notability Hi Ayo Oshunremi  Wikipedia has its own guidance for notability that may not be the same as your intuitive sense of what is notable Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia of general knowledge rather than an index of profiles of companies and people Each article needs several independent reliable sources to show significant impact on the historical record The guidance for organizations is given at WPORG and for biographies WPBIO applies  If the articles you are creating have reliable sources to support the criteria defined in that guidance then you may have a reason to keep the articles from being deleted which you are welcome to raise on the article talk page or on any linked deletion discussion If you are associated with the organization person or product the article is about then you must follow the conflict of interest guidelines and avoid editing the article yourself but you are free to suggest and discuss changes  Rather than starting live articles you can create a draft first which allows you to get your article properly sourced before risking speedy deletion  see Userspace draft and Userfication  If you would like some independent help you can ask one of the noticeboards at WPRequests or try chatting with other Wikipedians on   Thanks,0.0

FA Cup Final referees   Hi again Cris I see that you recently made numerous edits to the article on FA Cup Final referees with edit summaries contain words such as Sorry cant remember my source for Henry Pearce so feel free to ignore it or Sorry cant remember my sources for Arthur Holland but dont ignore it he was a VERY famous referee European Nations Cup Final etc etc For the time being I have reverted most of your edits not because I think that they are incorrect but because you have screwed the article up by incorrect or incomplete links eg by altering CW Alcock to Charlie Alcock and William Rawson to WS Rawson  When I get time I will try to go through your edits one by one and put things right  Some of your amendments were plain wrong however Its quite clear if you followed the links that Arthur Kingscott and Arthur H Kingscott were different people father and son If you think that the article on Arthur H Kingscott should be moved to Harry Kingscott this can be done Unfortunately most sources eg  and  just refer to AH Kingscott Can you point me to any other sources that can be cited on Wikipedia showing that he was known as Harry  Cheers,0.0

Its structurally very hard to get any significant change implemented If you put a lot of work in you may eventually succeed but itll probably take a lot longer than youd think One example is the Article Wizard  this took about 2 years from gestation to completing its implementation And that doesnt really challenge anyones power does it This sort of structural inertia is why I created WikipediaVillage pump idea lab to at least try and have a space where ideas dont get shot down so quickly Bottom line the difficulty of changing the governance is not unique  though its clearly a special case of being even harder The only solution is to keep trying to come up with new ideas PS The problem is not so much being given the tools indefinitely the processes for removal of tools where thats clearly warranted are not so bad The difficulty is in handling low and midlevel problems and a certain tendency from people whove heard Wolf cried too many times to dismiss any problems short of desysop now seriousness as either bellyaching from troublemakers or just minor stuff of the everyone makes mistakes variety More organised constructive feedback might help eg having a mandatory Admin review every year,0.0

Your recent reverts on Naturopathic medicine   I see that you have recently reverted some edits to the naturopathy page I note that you have given as your reason that the changes to the lead were POV but that you have not bothered to explain why you think this is so in the discussion page  Could you please explain why you think it is POV for the article to describe naturopathy as an approach to medicine rather than a single proffesion or standard of care Do you dispute the fact or the way in which it was written I am open to rewritingcompromising to get consensus on an NPOV but if you are not willing to explain yourself this will be very difficult Do you really think that the umberella term naturopathic medicine is represenatative of single entity group or way of practicing medicine Could you back this up  Could you also explain why it would be considered POV for the article to mention that the principles of naturopathy are practiced in multiple settings complementary alternative and primary care by traditional healers NDs MDs DOs DCs etc Again do you dispute this fact or the way it was written I have provided citations for this did you even consult them before deleting my work Can you provide a citation asserting the opposite that naturopathic medicine is an exlusive term owned and used by a single organisation to the exlusion of other types of practitioners Your assertion that naturopathic medicine is CAM not medicine could be misconstrued to reveal a deep and irrational bias on your behalf What do you imagine the M in CAM stands for The fact that the term medicine without a modifier is usually interpretted to mean conventionalregularnormal medicine does not mean that the less common practices are somehow not medicine  I hope that you will take the time to participate in the discussion of the above on the talk page I will continue to edit what I see as helpful NPOV information about the complex breadth and scope of naturopathy untill you can explain what it is that you do not like about the contributions I have made On the one hand I cant work in a vaccuum but on the other hand I wont be bullied into submission either  One more thought your vague references to various WPs could be viewed as a form of wikilawyering I hope that you will consider explaining the violations that you percieve rather than continuing to set up an all out edit war,0.0

Wikipedia style is for Wikipedia policy to determine I have trouble understanding this conflict people are saying such strange things Theyre sort of understandable from a new user like Mr Harvey who seems unfamiliar with Wikipedia policy and principles but I find them incomprehensible from a seasoned editor like Sam Spade It seems to me selfevident that if Mr Harvey controls the copyright then we cant use the image other than under the conditions he dictates And since those conditions include having an embedded uneditable caption in violation of the wiki principle that means we cant and wont use it at all Thats  apart from the phrasing of the caption being IMO quite unacceptableits enough that its uneditable Mr Harvey its just not the case that your regiment or the Queen for that matter is in charge of Wikipedia style You seem to assume that all thats needed for your caption to carry absolute authority is that a spokesman for the regiment should clarify the form of address  title that should be used and then it will it must be used You are wrong about that forms of address and titles used here are matters for Wikipedia consensus and policy Your employers are not empowered to dictate to the world how to speak I can understand that you think they are but I dont understand Sam at all Sam how can you see Mr Harveys demand to dictate the caption as part of an interpersonal conflict Its a conflict of principle You write I have recieved an email stating that Richard Harvey is the Photo Archivist at the Duke of Wellingtons Regimental HQ and that a condition of their usage is that the the name rank  title be embedded That is good enough for me I see no reason to doubt that this is the case or to refuse to utilise the images under these conditions Those two conclusions are miles apart No there is no reason to doubt it Yes there is every reason to refuse to utilise the image under such conditions Its a pity Mr Harvey has had second thoughts about the image he uploaded the first time the one without a caption and its well just odd that he sees cropping off the caption as defamation but well have to live with that,0.0

Actually my goal is to make a neutral POV present in these articles which involves removing the biased edits made by you two users You have both consistently  made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous POV edits I am not denying the link between Iberia and the British Isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic Europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions The relationship is only based on the Ychromosome and Mtdna inheritance shared with all Western European regions It needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r1b Ychromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both ychromosomes and mtdna There is very little to no evidence of autosomal and xchromosome analysis and when viewing the ychrommtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole R1b is found across western Europe in high frequencies but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other There is no genetic evidence yet of a Neolithic link between the British Isles and Iberia since R1b traces back to a Paleolithic Iberian refuge The Neolithic and following periods were quite different between the Iberian and the British Isles and the Neolithic Ychrom and Mtdna percentage is much larger in Iberia than in Britain or Ireland You also must not rely so significantly on references by Sykes or Oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles Ive read through both books and they really do make hasty unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to There are also books already out and also some to be released in the following months which  contradict and refute many of the findings or conclusions of Oppenheimer and Sykes Their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of DNA need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings I do agree that I should discuss my edits when I make them and I will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article,0.0

Black Jack   Hi Bugs Despite our differences you know I like you Or at least I hope you do But were you serious that I stumbled across Black Jack Pershing due to my knoweledge of the game of blackjack Im not sure if you were joking or serious In any case my interest in Pershing is largely tied to my interest in World War I Im not really much of a war buff but Ive always been interested in World War I as its largely been relegated to an afterthought in the wake of World War II World War II was not only a direct result of World War I it was basically just a continuation of it after a 30 year truce Ive also always been interested in the ways that that war was fought Europe had enjoyed decades of peace at the outbreak and military technology reflected that The war that began with bicycles horses and wooden ships was finished with tanks submarines and airplanes When Pershing took his troops across the Atlantic in 1918 he did so as the underdog and came out victorious In any case maybe you were joking about the whole thing but I hope that clarifies my interest in him for you,0.0

I think the page has an excessively critical tone with regard to Porporas work which I and many others feel is very nice I think it displays a common bias among musicologists against the work of composers not recognized as great  ie not household names among the uneducated Perhaps the criticisms section could include citations of who made the criticisms be prefaced with a statement like Some people find Porporas work bland boring etc or  better yet  balanced with a section discussing the positive aspects of his output and his undeniably significant influence on the music of both the late baroque and classical periods  I only regret that I dont have the necessary expertise about Porpora specifically to write these sections myself,0.0

The actual currency which exchanged hands would have been Euros and As the transfer was between a German and an English club the Leva doesnt enter anywhere into the equation The Leverkusen page should show the amount he was sold for in Euros the Tottenham page should show the amount he was bought for in pounds the Berbatov page except on the Bulgarian language version should show the amount in Euros Leva if used at all could only really appear on a page dealing with Bulgarian footballers or famous Bulgarians in general It is also worth noting that USD and Euro are extremely useful currencies to give values in because firstly they are highly stable and secondly most people in countries with local currencies will have a good understanding of the current value of one or the other relative to their own currency,0.0

Tram and trolleybus articles   Thanks for your comments  I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport particularly in continental Europe since the early 1980s and that of course is the subject matter of the newly translated template and the articles that are and will be linked to it  Until recently enwiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have  Although I cant speak Italian and can barely read it translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator  Since November last year I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations  Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in enwiki the itwiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step  Since I started work on my latest project I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in dewiki so I will start translating some of the dewiki articles soon  In the meantime I have just created one very long overdue enwiki article Trams in Milan not fully translated as yet and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days  Which brings me to a query about nomenclature  Theres quite a bit of material on both itwiki and dewiki about individual classes of trams and trolleybuses  However Im not sure how translations of those articles should be named  If an article is about a generic make and model eg Siemens Desiro then it can just be named as make model  But if a tram class is unique to a particular network the issue of naming is less clear  There are several enwiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form Wclass Melbourne tram  However that form doesnt seem right to me  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives eg British Rail Class 47  What do you think,0.0

Fine gentlemen but as it appears its only ourselves having this discussion allow me to submit this for your inspection as sent by Turner May 19 to all media the TPS and its Board blocked by the latter two and yes  Fantino himself in response to the latest headlines If you ever change your minds   Original to Leo Kinahan counsel for Sgt Jim Cassells  Mr Kinahan  Having discovered how sensitive you are about your email address note that I have included you as a BCC to protect your privacy As I have been battling with the media ever since my saga began I am only including them at this time in the hope that  considering the recent brave actions of your client and the resultant headlines which have followed  they may finally be forced to recognize my plight and resultant complaint since it all began  As briefly as I can describe it I was set up by 55 Division in November of  98 with a manufactured charge of Criminal Harassment as a favour to their local coffee hangout in my thenneighbourhood to obviate potential civil litigation I had against it and the parent chain Second Cup LtdCome trial the following year and representing myself I went to court with 39 witnesses several exculpatory documents and more   As a result of my actions and an airtight defence the complainant  who had been sexually servicing at least one 55 cop John Maciek  and two of my defence witnesses associated with the coffee franchise were paid to respectively take and avoid the stand  When this was articulated by myself the original two arresting officers Paul Scudds immediately afterwards appointed by Fantino to Internal Affairs itself and Sheila Richardson attempted to smash through my door without cause or warrant causing me to secure counsel ostensibly for my own protection in the person of Lorne Honickman  Where I lose all of the media in their zeal to protect one of their peers is the fact that Honickman took a bribe from Second Cup CEO  Michael  Bregman to throw the trial and protect their good name which resulted in his excluding every one of my witnesses ordering transcripts to be altered by a Ministry of the AG court reporter  who then bailed on both her employer and her apartment and went into hiding along with her sisterfellow AG employee who resided elsewhere refusing to admit documents and evidence to prove my innocence and more  After dismissing Honickman  but still having to return to court to continue the trial  I received a phone call at home on Friday January 7 2000 from 55s John Graham informing me that I would not make it to College Park alive with the evidence of all that I put before you now  Thirtysix hours later just after 1000 am on January 9 the threat was made good when a dozen cops from the division assembled themselves outside my door  armed with billy clubs black leather beater gloves and cell phones  with the stated intention taped phone messages retrieved after my toonarrow escape of killing me  Since then I have run the entire gamut of the complaint system including three cops I was publicly handed to by Fantino at his precious Town Hall meetings Stu Eley Wayne Cotgreave and Mike Trimble  stueleyonca waynecotgreaveonca  miketrimbleonca  Prior to  and after  this upon my own initiative were Bryce Evans bryceevansonca Dave Mcleod davemcleodonca and Steven Pipe stevenpipeonca all of whom have had the displeasure  or more the sadistic pleasure  of dealing withblowing me off  and who disappeared behind voice mail forever after as did the others plus every one of the usual suspects in Pro Standards  janewilcoxonca johnknaaponca  rickgauthieronca  that I was referred to and others including Scott Gilbert of 55 Division     scottgilbertonca whom I was forced to cooperate with by the OCCOPS and provided a gruelling eight hour video taped statement only to have same outright ignored  and my complaint dismissed  by the latter  During your clients original investigation I actually contacted  RCMP Supt John Neily and asked him to include my situation in the mix as Fantino was bleating about rooting out perjury and corruption I was subject to both during my trial and we cooperatively communicated for eighteen months only to have  come the moment of truth   Neily regretfully inform me that hed been ordered to drop my case  Now if youll allow me to quote from the most recent media reports   Yesterday at the regular monthly meeting of the Police Services Board Blair and board chair Alok Muk,0.0
Richard Frye Although the Tura in the Avestan Age were most probably Iranian perhaps the memory of the struggles with aborigines played a part in the development of the epic  Later of course the Turks conveniently took the role of the great enemies of Iran  The extent of the influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own history as well as that of Iran  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the family of Afrasiyab and so it is known in the Islamic historyRN Frye The Heritage of Persia The preIslamic History of One of the Worlds Great Civilizations World Publishing Company New York 1963 Pg 4041,0.0

Coup not Revolution   First off I removed the reference to after Yanukovich fled the country  The term fled is loaded and POV  To say he left the country is nonPOV but the statement added zero value in the first place  Second lets talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here specifically the difference between literal and figurative language  Revolution  A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time  Coup  The sudden and illegal seizure of a government usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body civil or military  Let me explain the difference clearly  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures  This clearly did not occur  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures  This clearly did occur  There was no revolution in Ukraine  There was only a coup  This position is nonPOV and sustainable  I recommend  Maidan Coup or 2014 Ukrainian Coup but the term Ukrainian Revolution is both POV and misleading  Note  Above I use the literal definition of Revolution to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures eg the American Revolution  Revolution also has a figurative definition of wideranging change eg the industrial revolution    Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV  For example neither the Velvet Revolution nor the Orange Revolution were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and having become widely recognized are appropriate titles in Wikipedia  That does not change the fact that they are POV  Nor does it change the fact that in this case there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming  I reiterate that the appropriate title is Maidan Coup or 2014 Ukrainian Coup,0.0

I think it could still use some cleanup  First some of the terms used for identities do match the terms used for the same identities on the List of trigonometric identities page  Ideally I think this page should match that one with the proofs linked between sections  Also the typesetting of the formulae does not match  Look at the equations in the angle sum section for details  Finally there is inconsistent layout between sections  For example the Eulerian proof in the Angle sum section is thrown in to the sum section  It seems to me it should really have its own at least sub header to separate it as is done for other identities on the page,0.0

Since I wont be around to implement this  do with it as you will   I have written up what I think would be a working compromiseand was going to post it on Mcshitheads talk page but since he has been such an asshole and will never collaborate with another view trouble is he runs the place and is so afraid of me he is shitting his pants with every word I writeLOL and you have had your peepee slapped because McGod is afraid of you too  Anyway here goes   Compromise I can understand almost all the views of most peoples concerns here As a compromise to most I would like to offer a possible solution to address most of those concerns for this otherwise conundrum  Extend Andreasegdes Triangular Diplomacy II solution from 2011 Before  anybody freaksout please read the rest This solution  would continue to promote the usage of pronoun references to band names midsentence while still retaining the ability to occasionally use the bands name or individual member references midsentence Complaints about the usage of all pronouns making boring repetitive prose in the article would be addressed by  adding this addendum to the previous Triangular Diplomacy II solution already observed by many  Midsentence usage of  both The Beatles and the Beatles be permitted occasionally with these caveats Provided an identifying phrase is used to indicate usage   When referring to band members  a lowercase t should be used ie the Beatles  when referring to the band as a corporate whole  an uppercase T should be used ie The Beatles   Some Examples  The Beatles were a rock band of great accomplishment  capitalisation is always used at the beginning of a sentence regardless  Paul became a Beatle  obvious individual nongroup reference no the or identifying phrase needed  Paul became one of the most popular members of The Beatles band  whole group reference with band identifier and also obvious context  Paul became one of most longlived members of The Beatles band  group reference with band identifier and obvious context  George Martin became involved with The Beatles group later  group clarifies corporate group usage meaning  After the event the individual Beatles went separate  ways  individual clarifies individual member context  After the event the Beatles individuals went separate  ways  individuals clarifies  After the event The Beatles members went separate  ways  members clarifies the bandgroup a gotcha  If people have other extreme examples perhaps we can see them in order to fine tune and clarify to satisfy almost all collaborative editors This solution could resolve most of the concerns stated in this medcom proceding Future editing from newer editors may violate these seemingly complicated rules but would be easy to fix with addition of either simple words or cap correction and a references to some posted MOS rules The only arguments I can see that may arise would be whether the band or the individual members are being referred to The simple fix for these disputes would be to return that particular sentence back to the Triangular Diplomacy solution This would appear to be inline with hundreds of other musical articles already observing a similar de facto standard Any violations would be easy to correct and violations would not look outside of most grammar usage anyway I dont really see any other way to satify so many different concepts here Trademarks dont work and the MOS contradicts itself and grammar in many places If this solution is even remotely desired by the majority andor medcom team here this could be fine tuned by controlled input to medcom  mediators Also implementation methods for clarifying to newcomers would need input on how to set up the MoS page possibly Beyond my knowledges This MoS should apply to all musical articles if we can make it work Have a nice life If I am still here in a few hours Iwill drop back in harrass the crap out of you some more ROFL,1.0

0249 21 September 2012   There are so many assumptions here I dont know where to begin Ill limit my comments to one aspect The Punisher does not have Batman or Green Arrowlike extraordinary abilities which have the beginning of their character conceptions were of levels beyond recognizable human reality The Punisher is a good shot but not depicted as someone who like Green Arrow essentially never misses The Punisher also doesnt go swinging from building to building and performing other such unrealistic superhuman derringdo as Batman does  things clearly beyond realistic human ability These are just examples As for Rorschach the Wikipedia article for which lists him as an antihero hes certainly not depicted as a superhero anywhere except possibly in flashbacks hes portrayed as a sociopathic vigilante  We can quibble over details about fictional people and this arbitrary madeup concept of superhero Im more concerned about why one person has such an obsession to label the Punisher a superhero If nothing else comics and other forms of literature have a variety of types of characters thats what helps make literature rich and interesting The Punisher is clearly not conceived of as a superhero in any traditional sense Im sure character creator Gerry Conway would be the first to agree The Punisher modeled on paperbackbook vigilantes in the wake of the film Death Wish is an antihero in any rational sense of the term To accept the specious argument that he is a superhero is to essentially erase the very concept of antihero to say it doesnt exist I dont think thats within our power,0.0

Neither of you addressed my point about self description or the official description of the school and the state What about the stance of the more than 500k alumni How many people have describe something that is their own it their own way before it can be accepted I concede that the term may be idiosyncratic but it is certainly not intended to obfuscate anything I urge you to find an example of the Chief ever being called a mascot in an official capacity by the university or the state The term mascot may apply but as a secondary description to the preferred term I do not wish to exclude the term mascot simply to place it as secondary to the preferred term Additionally I present other arguments Chicago El is called so by the local population However outside of Chicago most people would call the system a rapid transit system and later in the article it is in fact described as such In the opening paragraph clear preference is given to the local name even though consensus among the wider world community is that it is a rapid transit system What about Chief Osceola from FSU In that article he is described as a symbol there is zero mention of mascot I would argue that the performance of Chief Osceola is identical in spirit to the performance of Chief Illiniwek Both are meant to pay reverence to American Indian Culture In fact Chief Illiniwek existed for 36 years prior to Chief Osceola,0.0

I would advise you to concentrate for instance on Francis commentary reproduced at footnote 29 to the article about the dirty presence  in Portuguese  presença suja  of AfroBrazilians and then to think if being highly critical of such a commentary can be considered as biased Well if you want to discuss technicalities and nitpicky semantics yes it is biased but this isnt the particular issue Im addressing  This article seems to be moved by an active lack of confidence in the readers own judgment The sentence is elusively racist and it stands by itself How was it received overall Positively Negatively Was there as you said a character behind it Was that seen as a sorry excuse by many people Let the reader know both sides you wont build his opinion by concealing information  eg Francis was indeed slapped by Tonia Carreros husband but later apologised The reader will see this and decide whether the apology was enough  The documentary by Hoineff mentioned by you in the link above received a critique in O Globo last Sunday for limiting itself to the usual line of saying how great Francis was and that his mistakes his bigot commentaries were only jokes playing a character At least sources more critical of Francis have the merit of taking him seriously It is on Wikipedias POV policies that you have to represent the magnitude of each side properly For instance you see little merit in not taking him seriously I too think sarcasm is sometimes an easy scapegoat but the page isnt about my opinion or yours its about him and about the entirety of opinions available on him eg something like supporters claim he was often misinterpreted through his sarcastic persona yet critics think said persona is used as an excuse for ignorant statements could be helpful People themselves shall judge which position is more valid no  Also the Estadao article serves as an example of a supporter Yours of the Globo remains as the example of a detractor  they both are biased in their own ways they both represent a significant fraction of popular opinion on him I am defending that you and others actively  give each side its due weight and be confident enough in your own position that you let the overall repercussion of his work speak for itself  Anyhow thanks for keeping the Neutrality tag,0.0

Well Alan the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of onehitters to the latter issue remains important You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe tobacco is allowed to run on for over 23000 bytes all drawn from only 3 notes 3 references 5 external links with 11 pictures compared to Onehitter smoking with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures  Factbase I should google this first but I think I saw an article stating that only 1 of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe compared with 5 cigar and 94 cigarettes if 110 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10 of cannabis users used a onehitter on that basis alone besides there being ethnic onehitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length I think the value of the article depends partly on some information particularly history which is conveniently presented in picture captions so how about I look into using the gallery approach which posts the pictures at the bottom of the article smaller than the regular thumbnail kind but enlargeable,0.0

Actually youre quite right I ran out of time and had to leave before I could complete it  But saved what I wrote for later edit as I expected to change computers  I did not expect anyone to respond so quickly  My error  Since your contribution Ill forgo editing and start anew to prevent confusion  You hit upon my major editing intent  to talk a bit about the blurred lines between categories  For instance late Berlin is as easily categorized as House as New Music  In the case of Depeche Mode they actually announced their intent to head into the club scene  thus we know it was a conscious decision  But as for the others such as The Cars they simply progressed into a more mainstream sound over time  We actually agree on the major points you made However in my mind there was more or less a definition of the genre that one could use at that particular time  For instance in 1981 through 1983 the popular band Duran Duran was clearly New Wave But I considered Sly Fox and Haircut 100 as also New Wave even though they were completely different  This despite the fact that I was not cognizent of what was on the producers minds at the time  we had no real internet with which to easily look up such things  The fact that the producers and I both agree on what was clearly the New Wave sound would be an astounding coincidence if it were just coincidence  But it is not coincidence  there was a definite sound to it no matter how difficult it may be to clearly define it  Many of the bands attributed to New Wave were equally considered Punk or Pop  The Cars first three albums could be considered both Pop and New Wave but their Heartbeat City and subsequent albums saw them move away from the New Wave sound or at least as I defined it circa 1981 when the genre hit its stride so to speak  We cannot define where the the edge of one genre ends and another picks up but perhaps we can define the quintessential center of a genre at a particular time knowing that the center will drift is some direction from year to year  Consider my own preferences tended to drift towards the Pop side of the New Wave spectrum while someone elses preferences may drift towards the Punk or the Techo sides of New Wave  All the music could be considered part of the New Wave genre but all three of us could be listening to completely different bands  In a way one could argue that New Wave put the three genres together similarly to the way Fusion did with world music  Perhaps you are correct and Im trying to define something that can never be clearly defined or agreed upon  As you can see it being merely impossible did not stop me from trying though  But if you think Im mangling this Wiki I shall desist and give permission to edit or delete any and all of my contributions  0945 EST 8 February 2006,0.0
2005 UTC  Its worth pointing out that we are talking about a misuse of a phrase not a spelling error or a whole dialect The arguments above are irrelevant Begging the question has a clear meaning and it is still used with that meaning The more recent misuse should noted in the article nothing more  2020 Feb 8,0.0

US law before the recent changes in Dominican laws clearly stated that dual nationality was illegal It took a Supreme Court decision and the fact that Dominican law also prohibited dual nationality until the 1990s Mr Lithgows father was born in the DR simply because his mother was there when she had labor pains is father can be added to the list with the mention that he was born in the DR however John does not qualify for inclusion  Many Americans such as John Sununu born in Cuba John McCain born in Panama etc were born in Latin countries however they always had US citzenship and do not have any cultural blood political ties to the countries they were born John Lithgow does not refer to him as Dominican does not speak Spanish etc Just like Sununu and McCain their children do not get added to list of Cubans and Panamanians simply because their father was born there Many Haitians born in the DR are denied Dominican nationality They deserve to be recognized as Dominican more so than John Lithgow Once again Johns father can be added to the list with the mention that he was born in the DR however John does not qualify for inclusion His name will be removed Thank you for your understanding,0.0

Ahhh  I see what youre getting at  What we should probably do then is disclaim anything from the Tech ARP source with something to the effect of According to documents obtained and published by technology web site Tech ARP  like I said there are a lot of tech news web sites that are repeating this and the quality of the information shown in the Tech ARP documents is pretty consistent with how Microsoft goes about things so I believe it should stay in  Thats what WPV would have us do    As for the clean install part well Vista only supported direct upgrades from XP not 2000 so its not out of the realm of possibility that theyll only support directupgrading from Vista  The Register contacted Microsoft on the topic of XP  7 upgrades and they responded with I can confirm that customers will be able to purchase upgrade media and an upgrade license to move from Windows XP to Windows 7  however they will need to do a clean installation of Windows 7  This requires the user to back up their data install Windows 7 reinstall the programs and restore their data For PCs running Windows Vista customers have the option of an inplace upgrade of Windows 7 keeping their data and programs intact or to perform a clean install of Windows 7  So thats that  If Microsoft announces something different in the future then we can amend the article,0.0

Sitush you are a menace to Wikipedia as this conversation from the page of another editor shows  Are you a 15 year old kid trying his hand in editing academic articles   First Lilit Shastri writes to Jonathan This is because Sitush has just vandalized his article about Singahi Bhiraura and reduced it to four or five lines via numerous reverts here is the letter Later you will see that  Sitush interjects and gives some lousy reasons for his numerous reverts to the article which are academically illogical but  ever trigger happy with the revert button Situshtalk goes about his business as master referee Its the same story with other articles Sitush has edited on Wikipedia Some long standing editors have got impatient with him  Dear Jonathan  I agree with WPOR but if you read the sources on the article carefully and compare it with the guidelines to quote The prohibition against OR means that all material added to articles must be attributable to a reliable published source even if not actually attributed  Here is the list of attributable reliable sources of the article which were republished and meet the guidelines  There are Papers from the AN Seely Collection This a a British Library Publication 1972 which is a reputable Publishing House AN Seely the author was a fellow of Trinity College Oxford and a scholar in Persian Studies He compiled these from the original sources and they were published  Title Caste in the Subah of Oudh Army by AN Seely Collection Area India Office Records and Private Papers Reference IORLMIL14223 Creation Date 18901895 Extent and Access Extent 1 volume The India Office Records are the repository of the archives of the East India Company 16001858 the Board of Control or Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India 17841858 the India Office 18581947 the Burma Office 19371948 and a number of related British agencies overseas The focus of the India Office Records is in the territories now included in India Pakistan Burma and Bangladesh and their administration before 1947 The Records also include source materials for neighbouring or connected areas at different times covering not only South Asia but also Southeast Asia Central Asia the Middle East and parts of Africa The official archives of the India Office Records are complemented by over 300 collections and over 3000 smaller deposits of private papers relating to the British experience in India The India Office Records are administered by The British Library as part of the Public Records of the United Kingdom and are open for public consultation Title Caste in the Subah of Oudh Army AN Seely Collection Area India Office Records and Private Papers Reference IORLMIL14223 Creation Date 18901895 Extent and Access Extent 1 volume Title Pasi Chamar and Low Caste casteunder Brahmin Land ownership Oudh Collection Area India Office Records and Private Papers Reference IORZE425C516 Creation Date 18541855 Extent and Access Extent 1 entry Related Resources See entry at IORE4825 p986  NOW HERE SITUSH GIVES HIS CLASSIC REASON FOR DESTROYING THIS ACADEMIC ARTICLE ITS CLEAR THE FELLOW HAS NOT HAD ANY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE OR AUTHORED ANY ACADEMIC WORK   It doesnt matter who published the papers the underlying content is primary material For example there have been similar issues regarding the works of Henry Miers Elliot who basically reproduced ancient Indian texts I know some members of the Seely family as it happens but diaries letters office reports etc are not reliable sources Someone needs to write a book about them not a book containing them Furthermore Raj sources generally are not deemed to be reliable and especially not for matters of caste and history  Sitush talk   The above is classic Sitush  MY COMMENTS REGARDING SITUSHS REMARKS  Sitush you are an ass I do not know who let you loose on Wikipedia NCRT textbooks are writtin from the sources in the India Office Archive Every historical work including that of Seely depends to some extent on primary sources that work has been published and the authors of the Singahi article have cited from it These are spurious and non academic grounds of objecting to the article Its just making mischief I invite anybody from a higer academic background to examine all Sitush Sitush talk edits  Examining Situshtalk edits all over Wikipedia as I have done establishes he is a menace and taking wikipedia backwards Sitush I suspect you are just a 14 year old kid treating wikipedia as a toy,1.0

Please consult the article Ball culture which states drag queen or transgendered WPOR does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together  As well the term Femme queen does not have an article so the term is currently of dubious usage as its a neologism which WP policy suggests to avoid using  You state a source TGMSMNET however neither this page nor the mainpage refer to such a reference  From the way you talked about it I linked it to the MSTSW reference  In the future if you could could you please site resources on this page by using this form   That way it shows up like this  and one can simply click on the resource rather than search through the article for the reference itself  Your data is backed up there as well  However we still have issue how would the CDC consider a postop MTF living in stealth as anything else but a female the MTF would obviously not admit to being a transsexual and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a biological female  I wait for further evidence that TGTS is caused by biological factors and thus the term biological malefemale becomes complicated in even research no one would ever state that a woman with CAIS is biologically a male  As well I understand the point of not using WP as a soap box however in talk pages Im still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term people having URAP,0.0

Thank you for checking Ive asked another editor who has more experience dealing with NFCC about this Id imagine that the source links for other files have died over the years so perhaps some kind of precedent has been established It might be a good idea to download the image and keep it for safe keep just in case That way if by chance it does end up being deleted it can be recreated if the source is eventually found Another idea is to try and find out why it was removed from Northcliffe Media and figure out if it can be readded I was able to find something which looks like a logo on an archived page but it is quite different from the one you uploaded and Im not sure if 1 it was even used and 2 if it is OK to use an archived page for the source I was also able to find this old page but still no logo,0.0

I read the cited reference It is extremely vague about actual facts All I can discern is that Kennedy wrote Andropov not the KGB offering public relations advice The specific contents are not mentioned at all This makes me extremely suspicious No sourcing for the treason language was provided it appears that possibly some blog used the term If you care to rewrite it please focus very carefully on the actual _facts_ presented in the source and not their spin or interpretation CNS is quite partisan All I could find was one fact satisfying both WPRS and WPV  That a poli sci prof said Kennedy offered public relations advice to Andropov I think we should wait until the major press have had a go at it and some actual facts memo contents for example are available before spending a lot of energy on it,0.0

Plot   The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledores tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression At Shell Cottage Harry Potter sits in front of Dobbys grave gazing into the one way mirror He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestranges vault at Gringotts so he Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor a bargain to which they reluctantly agree Harry then questions Ollivander who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy While he confirms that Dracos wand is safe to use he cautions Harry about Bellatrixs wand as it is unyielding and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first  With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermiones unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thiefs Downfall and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuffs Cup the Horcrux but set off the Geminio curse causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup saying that he never said he would help them get out only in He runs for it and calls security the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure Setting the dragon free it wreaks havoc killing several goblins including Bogrod crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back After jumping off the dragon into a lake Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen Choosing to keep Nagini by his side he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe  Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters waiting for Harry The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the TwoWay mirror hung up on the wall Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission go into hiding and save themselves Harry said that he trusts Dumbledores judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Arianas portrait to bring them into Hogwarts Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesnt know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaws Diadem might be it despite no one alive today having seen it Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harrys break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall  In the hall Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harrys location to tell him immediately or face punishment Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall Snape draws his wand in anger bu,0.0
About Yaron Matras Madaares edits  Yaron Matras nonRomani Professor in Linguistics at the University of Manchester with the username  keeps adding the mention that the Ḍom  Rom theory is the mainstream an obvious personal POV Yes it has anteriority as compared to Rajput  Rom theory but is certainly no mainstream It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the antiRomani stereotypes and prejudices There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin Plus the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific And if it finds supporters mostly among nonRoma as fitting their ideas about Roma this does not mean it is mainstream The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide  I did not have previous encounters with Yaron Maras but I see that this first one does not look at all as a positive one I am not a member of any Romani Union of Romania and I dont know of the existence of any such union It is sad that he resorts to such cheap intimidations probably fitting himself the image of those nonRomani researchers who seem to feel threatened by Romanies who are educated or who are branded as activists as though this were automatically a bad thing as presented by Ian Hacock at Romani Origins and Romani Identity A Reassessment of the Arguments Is this a new proof that the Romani studies done by some nonRomanies are some of the last contemporary studies made in a colonialistic style,0.0

Where to put full versions of abbreviated citations   Re this edit which I mostly reverted Ive run into similar problems elsewhere where a few works are cited many times and its useful to collect the the full citations into a section and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section which isnt exactly appropriate as Further reading is supposed to be for books that werent used as sources I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations but its a bit weird and nonuniform to have the section title move to the newlyadded section when you need the new section I vaguely recall seeing an listoffullcitations section called Bibliography in some other article but thats not appropriate either as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article I dont know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome References isnt clearly wrong and is arguably better than whats in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos not only because it doesnt abuse Further reading and References as titles but also because it puts the most important references first,0.0

Yes I lost my temper over something of no great importance  But to be clear my first edit was to revert what I saw as the removal of sourced material by an editor with very few edits  Then I reverted twice more with what I felt were clear edit summaries so I was not in violation of 3RR  I had no intention of reverting a fourth time  The other editor Arzul suggested I take it to talk when he reverted me the 2nd time but the talk page discussion indicated he had been outvoted which I mentioned in my 3rd edit summary  When he reverted again I lost my temper  What I said to him was over the line I admit that and I am sorry  Clearly it was not the proper response,0.0

Bit stuffing vs Padding   Bit stuffing is used for various purposes such as for bringing bit streams that do not necessarily have the same or rationally related bit rates up to a common rate or to fill buffers or frames The location of the stuffing bits is communicated to the receiving end of the data link where these extra bits are removed to return the bit streams to their original bit rates or form Bit stuffing may be used to synchronize several channels before multiplexing or to ratematch two single channels to each other I only know the above as padding Bit stuffing according to my Data Communications lecture is the process described afterwards which involves making sure reserved codewords do not occur within the data field,0.0
Vaguely  Really  Ive explained this in great detail  but whatever  Let me see if I can clearly explain how these subjects interrelate Various figures of differing fame have proposed teleological arguments for the existence of God technically any god but for all practical matters this mostly concerns the Christian God  These arguments from design are described in the Teleological argument article  They are rarely referred to as simply intelligent design and thus have little to no claim to that term for its common name A specific teleological argument is presented as science and an alternative to evolution  This purportedly scientific theory is called Intelligent design ID and it is described here in the Intelligent design article  It is not necessarily associated with the Discovery Institute and therefore claiming that this is the DI version is inaccurate  There are no strict versions of the teleological argument anyway there are different arguments from design made by different people and they are identified by the philosophertheologian who proposed them From my perspective the articles are wellorganized though not above improvements  If the name of the article on the scientific theory is a problem we ought to have a discussion about the names of these articles instead of trying to manipulate the lead of this one and obscure its topic  If Intelligent design is deemed to be the common name of the subject currently described in Teleological argument there needs to be a discussion with the folks there to change the name  This article can then be renamed to something else in the past Ive suggested adding creationism to the title For a less verbose explanation see dave souzas comment above,0.0

Ice treaty This caught my interest According to a contract which had been signed Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price Anyone here have any idea if this was with an American company or with the Hudsons Bay Company which maintained a post at San Francisco though perhaps not this late their post was at Yerba Buena town and had been founded in 1830  The reason I propose the HBC is that there was a treaty  more than one  between the RAC and the HBC on the latters provisions of dairy and meat and vegetables to Russian America maybe there was a reciprocal agreement  I cant imagine what treaty the RACRussia would have had with the United States that could have signed between 1824 and 1859unless this has something to do with US support during the Crimean War  Or  If its a contract with a private company other than the HBC then treaty is not the right word to use  if its a corollary to the AngloRussian Convention of 1839 or the earlier arrangements with either the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company  or some grandfathered contract re the agreement with Mexico over Fort Ross somebody please explain,0.0

_______________________________________________________________________  I have no problem with the Boeing report but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article  This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem The mass of a space tether goes up with length  Assuming it could take the thermal environment you can build a space tether out of kite string  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth hence not practical  That doesnt mean that you still cant use that kite string to fly a kite obviously you can  The difference is in the length  The space elevator is 100000 km long  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most  The same applies to skyhooks  You could build a 100000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isnt practical  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4000 km range is possible As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded  References 7 18 and 19 are open source  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers nonrotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google it is open source   Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers  For that I recommend the Tether in Space Handbook it is also open source on the internet see reference 7 You could also just read the abstracts for the nonopen source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept  Or you could just notice who is writing these reports NASA reference 19 Lockheed Martin references 5 8 9 and 10 and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory reference 7  Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie  To conclude with the Boeing report  The Boeing report says  1 His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 50 kms 16 kfts or Mach 16 airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass  50 kms is 64 of low Earth orbit velocity  A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built  I have no argument with this  2 Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 40 kms 13 kfts or Mach 13 would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass  40 kms is 51 of low Earth orbit velocity  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic  Again no disagreement  The tether tip speeds for the nonrotating skyhook examples in this article and in all the references I have listed start at 96 of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70 of low Earth orbit velocity  There is no reason to go any lower As a result the final line of the Boeing quote In general the nonspinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts  does not apply for two reasons  1 It doesnt apply to the skyhook lengths in the article and 2 it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks  Do you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the nonrotating skyhooks in this article  PS  The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it  Since you keep deleting references with your changes the reference numbers keep changing hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything  So please read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying If you run into any problems that you cannot resolve easily write me here and I will do what I can to assist you,0.0

Your comment in the SerbianAmericans talk page   I was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question I had posed a few months ago and I saw your comment there I thought it was interesting  Ive never before seen someone else write about an American ethnicity the same way I have thought about it I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast The Americans outside of the South that descended from pre20 c immigrants from the UK Ireland and Germany seem to have substantially  meshed together into a White ethnic group not just racially but ethnically as well  The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North where 19c immigrants mostly settled and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life Where for the more recent ethnic Whites this is not the case eg in the North So the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed I do not want to make false generalizations however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here   The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities The citycentred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language for the most part A few wellknown examples would be the Irish and ItalianAmericans of the Northeast So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community  cultural traditions endure What I am getting at is that so long as a UkrainianAmerican stays in a major city she has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity She wont have to abandon the culture of hisher community If she were to move to an area in the Southeast then it would be a completely different story   Id like to give you a further illustration  the Poles of Chicago Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so Many have had families there for well over a century There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later breakdown as they go their own ways   Ive written all of this to demonstrate how the ethnic Americans and people who ethnically not racially but ethnically identify as White are distinct ethnically from the more recent post1850 European ethnic communities in the major cities I find it all very interesting The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an AmeicanUS citizen and an ethnic American and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being unAmerican These people that do not make the distinction show frustration when a person does not abandon hisher culture and adopt their own This is of course on an individualbyindividual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or subregion  Ive seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or familyfriends from people of all sorts of backgrounds Ive seen it demonstrated by Southerners New Yorkers and even Jews in South Florida By the way most of the time my ethnicity and that of familyfriends would have been indeterminable by those people Im saying this because I dont want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racistdiscriminant than another region Ive spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago Its all unfortunate and these types of racist discriminatory and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries   The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where exYugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world  Sorry for the lack of brevity Your comment was interesting and I wanted to expand on it Also I want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the US or the US as a whole Usually when I do,0.0

please stop threatening youre throwing weight around in a way that mixes your admin power with that of a user elevating your opinion above that of others you have no right to do so do you think youre better than me if so youre wrong please stop addressing me as a child because youre an admin when i freely unilaterally removed the entire expose of OWB as a plagiarist was it relevant to the article and important to post temporarily it absolutely was because he was attempting to use his external article to gain POV power and he has been about as disruptive to the article as anybody could be that he still claims he didnt claim a single sentence of the article as his own work shows quite clearly what youre dealing with however because hes not an overt vandal his hand is held indefinitely enough  have you considered the damage done by treating two different people as equally at fault in a given situation i have noticed this before from you directly katefan and id appreciate it very much if you would at least examine it once more if you have already the result is the discouragement of wikipedias biggest asset editors who leave material that will last i am not your inferior so please dont treat me as such if you want to spend hours creating and encouraging editors who bring us things such as this with a dedication page no less then IMO youre misguided in any case i doubt quite strongly that you realize the effect of blasting into a situation announcing however subtly youre an admin and then acting as though youre just there to edit that is not how it works whether you realize it your introductions are often launched to establish passiveaggressive superiority ill say it again you are not my superior you have admin power here and are not a better editor than i am please halt with the admin intimidation for issues that if intervention were to be helpful require the intervention of somebody who at least acts sincerely as an equal not a parent why is that so difficult for admins to understand i know why but maybe you can give it a think  if you doubt the subtle influence of your position as an admin look no further than OWBs obsequiousness on your talk page users know what the score is im not going to play and ive demonstrated repeatedly that my article editing here at wikipedia is in the top layer im quite aware that many dont agree with my philosophy of human action and wikipedias future ie that encouraging disrupters and discouraging producers is a vacant policy but im going to push it as far as it will go it my theory begins by refusing to allow vandalistic interference in my comments thats not necessarily something you couldnt support katefan you know good editors could use the support of admins  far from the blitz onto the scene method where habitual disrupters and habitually superior editors are then treated as equal entities with fresh start mantras no its not the first time ive seen that from you katefan and an everybodys contributing equally approach that does nothing but swat the hands of editors whove fought sometimes alone and for days to preserve article integrity doesnt work with children nor with adults youre treating as children the presumption of theoretical equality of action when arriving on the scene is probably the biggest mistake admins make here  yes my objection to your fresh start approach on the BC discussion page is quite serious i dont believe that you should continue further in the facade of being an objective normal editor on the page you have set yourself up as everybodys superior and such an approach was not necessary why not let things sort themselves out a bit did you notice i bowed out after removing hundreds of my words did you notice that things were slowly improving without you did you notice that somebody else wouldnt bow out did you notice that i didnt immediately gut his atrocious frank hamer article as would have been well within the bounds of wikipedia policy if not why are you even pretending to help there are healthier methods of dispute resolution than dispute denial they may not seem as touchyfeely at first but the results are longer lasting and ultimately far more respectful OWB needed to face what he faced there and wikipedia and OWB will be better off if this process isnt pretended away you said something about i dont know what went on with you two really all that went on was utterly public ive had no private comm with OWB so if you dont know what went on then you didnt pay attention if youre not paying attention maybe you might consider stepping back and not jangling your admin keys so readily  i doubt what ive written here will make any difference but i figu,0.0

Thanks  Ill edit from the beginning of next month No harm in dropping a reply to your note since writing here is hardly editing wiki   Were Michaels mind open to rational persuasion he would have yielded on this long before His objection is at this point ideological More examples will not convince him  That we all get things wrong at times is easy to see What is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong and why we persist in error  On the IsraeliJewish side of this common problem there are two elements one cultural one a matter of the politics of imageforging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived I think Michaels error is to be classified in the former which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of Jewish exceptionalism and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise Palestinian realities that might remind one of similar Jewish realities is repressed Michael dislikes uprising because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the Warsaw uprising There is a deeper analogy The Romans crushed Bar Kochbas revolt which in the historical literature is often described as an uprising and under Hadrian set out to Romanize Judea The creation of Israel vindicates Bar Kochba but also in rejudaising Palestine creates an implicit structural analogy between the fanatic resistance of Bar Kochba and the PLOHamasthe AlAqsa type violence espsacred violence in the name of national restoration This analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myths of Jewish exceptionalism since those who evoke the myth of Masada must at the same time war down a native people who are battling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory very much as Bar Kochba himself did Rabbinical schools after the failure of Bar Kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states one which lasted until the creation of Israel redeemed the earlier foundational myths of the Book of Joshua and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic militancy of the first invasion of Canaan Ironically what is expected of Palestinians is that they cringe before the power of Israels occupation any phenomenon bearing a generic resemblance to the sicarii or zealotism is dismissed as an appalling Arab cultural trait though in fact it resonates mutatis mutandis with analogies from Jewish history under the Roman empire from Titus to Hadrian where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished The early Zionists from Jabotinsky to BenGurion to Moshe Dayan and Menachem Begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonances  Being thorough realists they didnt have to kid themselves Today we live in the fog of public opinion myths where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness People are raised on the standard clichés endlessly recycled by hasbara machines and underwrite them sincerely because they no longer have much of a sense of history Much could be said of this But this is not the placeRegards,0.0

Great Pyrenees as with other dogs will do exactly what they are bred and trained for Pyrenean Mountain Dogs were bred to guard the livelyhood and families of the mountain shepards  This did not require a lot of running  However it did require intelligence and a certain amount of independence  Such as recognizing threats and taking whatever action was necessary to neutralize the threat whether by force or by intercession I have found my Pyr will most often just get between the protectees goats usually sometimes grandkids and whatever is percieved to be a possible threat  No threats or growling or even confrontation just gets between them and lies down situation neutralized  Most intelligent dog I have ever owned11,0.0

Relevant to a mature understanding of this topic is Keyfabe  a term from the world of professional wrestling but which applies in a wider context  Individual cases require thoughtful judgment but one thing we should be clear on not everything in tabloids is true  A fair amount of it is staged PR fluff  Another portion of it is simply bad reporting that the stars dont complain about because it is harmless  There are often good reasons to take it all with a grain of salt,0.0

Issue with Map   Using the light green color for Crimea seems somewhat misleading and inconsistent The China map uses the same light green color for Taiwan even though the situations are not similar at all China has no control over Taiwan and the people dont want to join China Russia has total control over Crimea with the approval of its people In reality Crimea is not a contested territory except in the minds of politicians I think Crimea should be labeled as fully part of Russia on the Russia page and marked with some other color on the Ukraine page that represents territorial claims without control This should be the same color used for Taiwan on the china page A different color should be used to mark contested territories where multiple parties have actual influence over say if Crimea was controlled by Russia but its people were not happy with the Russians and were protestingrebelling,0.0

POV  I removed  Many fewer would have been shot down if not for poor planning and inflexibility by the mission planners of Strategic Air Command Specifically SAC ordered B52s to attack from highly predictable preciselytimed repetitive positions and altitudes This eliminated the element of surprise The NVA were able to aim their Sovietbuilt SA2 Guideline SurfacetoAir Missiles SAMs by simple timing and azimuth prediction Further complicating the situation for the B52s was the fact that SAC had used the same jamming electronic countermeasures techniques for years thus enabling the NVA to develop countercountermeasures  SAC ordered the B52s to make a steep turn after dropping the bombs This resulted in an interruption in the electronic jamming of NVA radars because the B52s jamming antennas which were located on the bottom of the aircraft were then pointed away from the radars To make matters worse the turn made the B52s face into a 100mph headwind which slowed their escape The NVA were surprised at first but after a few nights of these repetitive tactics they figured it out The NVA blasted several B52s with direct hits Two were damaged severely and crashed near UTapao Royal Thai Air Force Base The situation would have been even worse for the B52s if not for the inaccuracy of the SA2 system and the inexperience and errors of its NVA operators  SAC refused to change its tactics even when shown that the existing tactics were ineffective and highly dangerous to the aircraft and crews In part this was due to indecision on the part of SACs commander Also because of a topdown culture which had been originally established for nuclear war by General LeMay refused to listen to the suggestions of its aircrews The LeMay culture had discouraged open and frank discussion to the point that only yes men made it to the top of the SAC organization where potentially they might have been able to prod the SAC commander into a change of tactics Surprisingly NVA records and interviews with former SAM operators show exactly the opposite culture Realistic discussion and innovation were encouraged among the batteries commanders  Ironically although the NVA had run out of missiles by Day Four of the campaign and the B52s could have bombed an undefended Hanoi SAC was so rattled by its losses that it directed the B52s to targets outside Hanoi thus giving the NVA time to reload After that B52 losses mounted again  SAC commanders did their best to suppress revelations about their incompetence even going so far as to suggest that one of their critics was mentally unstable SAC has rewritten history in its official account of Linebacker II This semifiction is still taught at the USAFs Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama  It lacks NPOV or sources,0.0

Courtney Here are my suggestions from my Peer Review of your article Chunking Psychology  by Dan Hurlburt Considering the fact that this article was removed by a previous editor I just looked in the articles history and examined the latest edited form of the article before the changes were undone in order to complete my peer review  The lead section provides a good stand alone summary of Chunking in psychology  The article already has a strong intro that didnt require much editing in the form of adding new material It did however require some fine tuned modifications that I think she did a good job of locating and crossing out words and rephrasing sentences that needed to be more specific  The contribution does not seem to be cut and pasted from an existing source it flows well with the article and is properly placed   The terms used go along with the articles style well and are easy to understand  One sentence that sounds a little confusing when read is Runners may chunk the numbers into different relevant mile or other distances times May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across  In the Short term memory section the sentence  The short term memory processes stores information for about twenty to thirty seconds  I think needs a word or two added in in order to complete the thought I tried to include a suggestion     May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across  She relates to her references where it seems necessary  Even though the article already includes a decent amount of information she finds the areas that did need further elaboration and creates an appropriate section for the information  Grammar and verb tenses and spelling all match up well with the rest of the article  One area where a wiki link may help the article is in the section where she is talking about short term memory possible link to Short Term Memory but I dont think that it is necessary since she does explain it a little using a reference  Her references match up well with the rest of the ones listed in the document in format and when investigating them they all are relevant to the subject matter and provide useful information for the article  I dont think that any images would enhance the article considering the article already provides a good diagram that is explained well and fits the topic nicely,0.0

Moneybomb temporary working copy   This copy and edits thereto represent an attempt to demonstrate suggested edits for the purpose of issue resolution and consensus Minor formatting changes have occurred for userspace The first version will be the current live version followed by disputed text from 1128 0119 some of which may be temporarily invisible in comments the edited versions will demonstrate how the disputed text may be incorporated in accord with RS and other concerns raised in discussion  Working copy     Moneybomb money bomb moneybomb fundraising bomb Fawkes bomb is a neologism used to describe a grassroots effort to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing and concentrating the candidates fundraising activity during a specific hour or day The effort combines traditional and Internetbased fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidates notable success if any The term was used as early as 2004 but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States with its recordbreaking fundraiser of November 5 The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates  Origin According to The Politico the term was coined in 2007 The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th Guy Fawkes Day This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film V for Vendetta which depicted a modernday fascist Parliament overpowered by popular revolution that was led by V a Fawkeslike character  The 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented oneday online fundraiser in political history bringing in over 4 million On November 6 Ron Pauls campaign stated that in addition the free media coverage after the event was worth well over 10 million  The imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous Pauls campaign spokesman Jesse Benton clarified to the New York Times that Paul does not support blowing up government buildings He wants to demolish things like the Department of Education    but we can do that very peacefully in a constructive manner   Political consultant Ed Rollins commented of Pauls moneybomb What hes done  what his supporters have done  is astonishing    You cant dismiss his antiwar vote You cant dismiss the power of one man standing up with a powerful message Ill tell you Ive been in politics for 40 years and these days everything Ive learned about politics is totally irrelevant because theres this uncontrollable thing like the Internet Washington insiders dont know what to make of it  Followup efforts After November 5 independent sites were also created by volunteers for Barack Obama Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson paying the ultimate tribute to Paul by their imitation Thompsons campaign disavowed his supporters effort and did not release contemporaneous fundraising results after the fundraiser fizzled out and was speculated to have failed  Analogues When John Kerry accepted the Democratic nomination in 2004 he raised 57 million in one day partly over the Internet  On January 8 2007 the Romney campaign raised 3143404 The press widely reported that a oneday call center organized by Romney had raised 65 million in one day including both donations and pledges on that date  According to the New York Times the alltime oneday fundraising record among 2008 presidential candidates is held by Hillary Clinton who raised 62 million on June 30 2007  The press widely credited Paul with the oneday record for online fundraising as well as assigning Paul the overall Republican Party oneday fundraising record  References   CategoryNeologisms  Disputed text Moneybomb advertising often makes use of inverted political messages as in the case of ads for Ron Paul pictured and Mitt Romney  This usage of the term was coined in October 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States the practice came to prominence in its recordbreaking moneybomb of November 5 but the term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidat,0.0

Images are thumbed so that readers can load pages quickly and decide for themselves whether or not to see an image full size  Thumbing and then forcing them to a larger size defeats the purpose  Why you think that a photo of an empty pretty well generic gymnasium should have to be so prominent defeats me in any case Placing the oh so exciting image of a sign further down the page means that many browsers including mine see a forced break in the text The article only needs updating if some of it is out of date  Youre placing the template for the wrong reasons to make a point about the removal of the section  Thats at least perilously close to disrupting Wikipedia to make a point The consensus on Wikipedia talkExternal links was that multiple links to subsections of the same site are unnecessary and should be avoided,0.0

Hi Ive been checking articles that were edited by  andor his sockpuppets He created most of the articles about parishes in Madeira and the Azores unfortunately using a lot of fantasy I see that I removed some of your additions as well while removing his rubbish I must say Im not so fond of the present Geoboxes theyre pretty big and not all information in it is that interesting For instance the length and width of a parish or the localities up to 24 of those in some parishes Some information was obviously wrong for instance in Cabouco the lowest point of the parish is most likely not Pico do Machado The demonyms I removed were not specific for Cabouco but for the whole island and for the municipality so they should not be in this infobox I see the address of the freguesia admistration is actually given twice in the infobox under LAU location and parish address I think we should remove one of them But if you think I removed something thats worth keeping feel free to readd it preferably with a reference,0.0

I would like to shop online but I dont have a credit card or access to one  As soon as you read Nightdance I expect a fulllength gushing comment telling me how right I was P Its literally the best Halloween since the original Im totally in love with it  Good luck with your job hunt  What made you choose Michigan Well thats not true  I would argue that Nightmare is more than just entertainment it has depth and artistic value to it while still appealing to the Friday audience  I was watching Restless one day and realised how much potential the Nightmares could have if they bothered to develop their characters beyond onenote cliches theres a character in the remake whos on the swim team who wants to bet hes going to drown  I enjoyed both Texas and obviously Friday but Ive still to see Ammityville  Its kinda sad how out of all the main horror remakes Halloween is probably the weakest,0.0

What page No page was put up as an article  Per the Wiki guidelines nothing was put up as an article  A page was being utilized as a user page simply to figure out the structure of Wikipedia to learn the coding of  Wikipedia and to experiment with  Some text was simply cut and pasted onto a page per Wiki guidelines nothign was submitted as an article because the test area was to be kept to a user area  This is what we were doing  Using the user name as a testing area PER WIKI GUIDLINES  No article would have been submitted until such time as it met Wiki guidelines but you you deleted the page before that could take place  Are you really this obtuse  In all seriousness testing are refining articles in user pages is encouraged by Wikipedia  This is what we were doing  In our opinion you are not familiar enough with Wiki guidelines to exercise any control over the deletion of articles  It is the afternoon  Elementary school should be getting out soon  There should be some 9 year old that you can go outside and shove around  I regret that you have little authority over your real life but I dont think the intent of Wiki was for you to vent that frustration and lack of control in meatspace over the entirety of the Encyclopedia  Thanks for deleting the demo template you complete and utter fuckwit  Next time well just throw something into the public domain and give you something to actually do other than mentally masturbate,1.0

I think I can help with some explanation here as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry quantum physics and engineering The doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to The viewer is stationary yes but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties  This means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways One of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches and rise as it recedes from a viewer  The infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can in precise circumstances temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge Another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia Such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated and you can see the article slow light for more information You are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not infinite infinite inertia The infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance At the point that these conditions end the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic cage and reemmited I hope that I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials,0.0

The anarchist approach to justice is not to have a government monopoly in judicial matters Beyond that it depends on which school of anarchism Individual anarchists like Benjamin Tucker and modern anarchocapitalists would have justicearbitration services provided by a free market ie private courts whether they be firms mutuals or coops is up to the voluntary arrangement people choose for themselves Cf Defense Services on the Free Market by Murray Rothbard At the other extreme are the utopians who believe that crime will essentially disappear once the State is gone Classical anarchosocialist thought tend toward the latter and thus has little to say about justice,0.0

I drafted an different reply to your note above  But I decided the best course today is to request userification of the article and its talk page   The nominator and a large fraction of those who voiced a delete opinion apparently felt it was appropriate to make extensive excisions to the article  while it was before   This is what I meant by informationectomies and referencectomies  Our policies dont specifically prohibit this behavior but I think it is a terrible idea because it is best for the project for those who think the article should be kept to be allowed a free hand to try to address whatever concerns were voiced in the      I think that it is terribly erosive of the general store of collegiality civility and good will we should all aim to maintain when those in the delete camp edit war in articles while they are before  and should confine themselves to voicing their concerns in the   As I wrote in the  even if for the sake of argument everyone but those in the keep camp felt the keep case was hopeless those in the keep camp will feel the  was fatally disrupted by this kind of edit warring  Whereas if the delete camp are disciplined enough to refrain from interfering with the efforts of the keep camp in the actual article  If they can keep their hands off the article everyone including those in the keep camp cant speculate that the article would have been kept if it hadnt been for the edit warring   Anyhow due to their disruptive efforts the article when deleted was not at its best state when you closed the discussion  If you reversed yourself and restored the article to article space it would probably be nominated a second time almost right away  If and when it is restored to article space I would prefer to defend a version of the article that shows no echo of the disruptive edits of those in the delete camp,0.0

Since we are citing the Constitutions definition it is of fundamental relevance to state that Sikhs did not accept the Constitution itself The reason they did not accept it is because minority rights were not protected because the Constitution did not even recognize the minorities to be separate from Hindus   On 27th August 1947 the Constituent Assembly of India had passed a resolution that the question of minority rights in Eastern Punjab will be considered separately but subsequently minorities subcommittee recommended that no special safeguards will be provided to the Sikhs Sikh representative Sardar Hukam Singh and Bhupinder Singh Mann had refused to append their signatures to the Constitution of India and Sardar Hukam Singh on 21st November 1949 declared in the Constituent Assembly  Let it not be misunderstood that the Sikh community has agreed to this Constitution I wish to record an emphatic protest here My community cannot subscribe its assent to this historic document  no special safeguards will be provided to the Sikhs is equal in part to Sikhs not being regarded as a distinct minority In the following 65 years this issue has come up many times and Sikhs have always objected to the Constitutional definition and for not having agreed to it,0.0

GA Review  This review is transcluded from TalkAir India Express Flight 812GA1 The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review  Reviewer     which at around 0630 local time on 22 May 2010  You should note which time zone it is referring to when it says local time or better yet just put the time in UTC  Some references are in the wrong places because it looks like some statements are unsourced This is the situation in the following statements Initial reports from survivors suggested a tyre burst6 as the aircraft attempted a goaround  Move reference 6 to the end of the sentence 800 feet 240 m54 well before the aircraft made a touch down  Move reference 54 to the end of the sentence  and also of the alleged hostile attitude of the airlines counsel80 Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India DYFI along with Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airlines office in Mangalore where they submitted a memorandum to officials demanding that families of the victims receive early and equitable settlements of compensation due They also demanded the settlement process be made more transparent by opening it to the media rather than holding sessions in camera  Either the reference 80 is in the wrong place or this statement really is unsourced The units of measure are inconsistent as to whether it is American first or metric first eg 2000 feet 610 m and 90 metres 300 ft they should be American first and metric last or vice versa but not both Some of the references contain errors Reference 12 is missing the date which was May 8 2011 the bottom of the page says it was last updated on that day Reference 14 is a bare url and is missing all information BTW why is it linked to a plane crash in 1981  Reference 16 is missing the date 27 April 2011   There is a typo in the title on reference 20 it should say 158 die 8 survive in Air India Express plane crash in Mangalore not 159 die 7 survive  Reference 24 is missing the publisher The Hindu and the date 16 December 2006  Reference 28 is missing the date 24 May 2010 Reference 29 is missing the author Chand Naseeb   On reference 31 add the author either as CNN Wire Staff or Singh Harmeet Neisloss Liz Razek Raja Deaton Jennifer BTW you have the wrong title it should be Air Indias flight data recorder sought  Reference 33 is missing the author Mines Javier The url for reference 42 redirects to the video homepage and not what it was intended to link to  Reference 43 is missing the date 27 May 2010 Reference 50 is missing the date 3 August 2010  Reference 51 is missing the author Proulx Jim and the date 21 May 2010  The url for reference 57 has a similar problem to reference 42  Reference 58 is missing the author Nandy Chandan  Reference 61 is missing the date 26 April 2011  Reference 64 is missing the author Raghuram M  Reference 69 is missing the author Fernandes Ronald Reference 73 is missing the author Hradecky Simon and the date 26 April 2011  Reference 76 is a bare url and is missing all information  Reference 77 is missing the date 23 May 2010,0.0

See Also  Hi Gene I saw that you reverted my edits on a couple of pyramid related pages to include links to the pages on Ukrainian and Bosnian pyramids and for links to the pyramid category as well I just wanted to clarify why these links do not belong The Bosnian pyramid is considered a hoax If the digging on the Bosnian hill does eventually reveal a pyramid then the links are justified However until proof of a pyramid is found the site remains a hill with an archeologically significant medieval village on top In the case of the Ukrainian pyramid the press simply carried a wrong impression of the site into the popular culture This innacuracy was soon clarified by the archaeologist in charge    Please do not revert the external links sections of pyramid articles again I am well aware that the Bosnian and Ukrainian pramids are not really pyramids and that the scientific consensus supports this  however that is entirely beside the point the main reason they are known by most people is because some people claimed they were pyramids it is not for us to make value judgements concerning those claims our job is simply to provide links to all pyramidelated articles and let people read those articles and decide for themselves The see also list is a list of related subjects  it is not merely a list of legitimate pyramids Gene_poole    I think when something is either falsely called or accidentally called something it is not no reasonable source of information would list it said entity under the misleading heading For example when a toddler calls a car a boat the rest of the world does not have to amuse the toddler by now considering cars as boats because some people claimed they were boats I realize youre taking an inclusionist stance on this and I respect that However I think the fact that the articles themselves are already improperly named is inclusionist enough Including the Ukrainian and Bosnian pyramids in a list of legitimate pyramids is very efficient way to undermine any intellectual weight this encyclopedia has I think making lists of things which are entirely opposed to the scientific consensus and in the case of the dig site in Ukraine against the stated clarification by the archaeologist leading the dig is irresponsible To that end I am once again making my reverts but in the interest of fairness I am also moving this conversation to the talk pages of the articles,0.0

Neutrality tag The tagged section is not only neutral it is primary verification of what JfJ claim to believe It would be very odd indeed if the communism article did not reference communist sources for what communists believe The section states what JfJ believe it makes no claims about what Wiki believes nor what the editor who put it there believes nor what a reader should believe It is therefore an verifiable NPOV reporting of a group that is itself obviously not neutral My reading of this article is that although technically neutral in its presentation it starts by presenting all the negative views of JfJ That does not seem logical A neutral reader wants to know firstly what JfJ believe then what others say neutral pro and con Example Jane Does netball teams mission statement says Play quality netball  The Netball League recently described the team as dedicated but lacking experience The Fan Club website features team captain Jane praising her creative and inspiring  Their main rivals have claimed that the team uses unsporting methods like sledging  Im sure people understand the point,0.0

Voting history for RI switches   I reverted the  to the Voting history table because in my opinion it was not appropriate as no vote occurred he was not eligible to be voted against at the time at Tribal Council and he wasnt removed from the game for medical reasons  This RI switch thing could potentially make the Voting history table a mess if a switched person is added in ever time  I think the table should only include actual TC votes or medical removalquits  Similarly the  should only be done when Jeff initiates a switch and the switch is forced  Im bringing this up now so we can discuss how the table should work for future switches if there are any In other words set the precedent now,0.0

One final point that may not be apparent to contemporary readers  We have a hard time understanding today why anyone would think a spherical earth implies habitation on the far sideafter all the entire backside could be endless ocean right  Or barren desert  But to the early Medievalist the earth was created by God for the purpose of providing home to mankind  It seemed incomprehensible to such men that God would create an entire second world below and unreachable from the firstand leave it wholly empty  In their anthropocentric viewpoint this was outrageous  And this is much of the justification for the tacit linkage between rotundity and inhabited antipodes in many early MA sources,0.0

Re If theres a rocket   S I took a preliminary albeit belated look at the Snow Patrol song If Theres a Rocket Tie Me to It I think it needs tweaking in the writing after having seen the video for it and have begun making minor wording changes If you disagree tell me They focus around the description of what takes place in the video use of words like the band members admiring the origami etc doesnt feel right I think examined would be a better word Sure Im picky but I think its more accurate and there are a few other words like that which made the wording sound just a little silly so I made a few changes Also they are on a beach Wouldnt a beach have a bungalow on it rather than a cottage right on the sand by the waterline There isnt a mention of the Japanese lanterns hanging from above though that may not have any importance Last shouldnt the synopsis of the video mention Lightbody singing throughout their wandering and mention that the second half of the video shows the band performing the song there on the beach Oh a couple more things about references Your comment that The Irish Times Hated it  Where is the reference for this  Hate is a really really strong word Id assume that their critique would be in English too and yet by using Google the only times I was able to find that comment was from every other site it seems who are quoting from YOU perhaps not a good thing I also think there were too many references where the reader would have to know foreign languages or subscribe to whatever paper or periodical to see what they had to say  Personally I would have said that the Irish Times panned the song or some such word  I think this all sounds harsh but I think you know that I want the best results for your projects and for myself it truly is an outsiders view but an insider who has read a lot of song pages here,0.0

Since this is currently the only place I am allowed to post Ill post this here for Upstater I dont want you to get in trouble for defending me you are right that I should ignore Hippo and you should probably do the same right now I dont want to be responsible for you slipping up and saying the wrong thing and then you get even just one warning you have a very spotfree record and I dont want any blemishes because of me which I wish other admins would notice and figure if you were defending me then perhaps the block was premature and unnecessary but that is unlikely though I do wish I could contact Sandstein to reconsider and allow me to explain and show why it wont happen and that I am sorry I just think the best thing is for us to be ever vigilant regarding WPCAPDIS articles and make sure no one does anything to them for an unencyclopedic reason,0.0
July 3 2011 Game   I saw there was some disagreement about the Mets win that game The argument about the Louis Castillo game being the same thing is not something I agree with That dropped pop up is something that never happens and that is what makes it significant that it happened in the rivalry I think the 22 straight chances of Rivera converting could be notable but only if it is some sort of record that was broken or some personal achievement reached,0.0

Ringerfan23 I just want you to let you know that you appear to alienate a lot of people on Wikipedia Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance your actions were shameful When faced with a group of people who reached consensus you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your poorly reasoned point of view These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about I think you should grow up recognize that your positions are often incorrect and defer to the democratic process Seriously why do you think your opinion is so important that your beliefs should outweigh a consensus  Preceding unsigned comment added by,0.0

I was not notified about the deletion suggestion before the PROD expired so I didnt find out about the deletion until now  I do not see how either of the two guidelines you quoted are applicable in this case  The article to which Vatican twins redirected was merged into the sibling article not deleted  For this reason it would make sense for Vatican twins to now redirect to the Irish twins section of sibling  As for WPWINAD that guideline was written in order to keep unencyclopedic stubs from being created  If a concept has two different names either name should direct a user to the appropriate article when it is typed into the search bar  That is the purpose of redirects  Would you object if I recreated Vatican twins as a redirect to SiblingIrish_twins,0.0

would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you Youre a putrescent mass a walking vomit You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt You are a jerk a cad a weasel Your life is a monument to stupidity You are a stench a revulsion a big suck on a sour lemon You are a bleating foal a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world An insensate blinking calf meaningful to nobody abandoned by the pukedrooling giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you You are a monster an ogre a malformation I barf at the very thought of you You have all the appeal of a paper cut Lepers avoid you You are vile worthless less than nothing You are a weed a fungus the dregs of this earth And did I mention you smell Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers but they will be able to access it more rapidly You snailskulled little rabbit Would that a hawk pick you up drive its beak into your brain and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood May you choke on the queasy convulsing nausea of your own trite foolish beliefs You are weary stale flat and unprofitable You are grimy squalid nasty and profane You are foul and disgusting Youre a fool an ignoramus Monkeys look down on you Even sheep wont have sex with you You are unreservedly pathetic starved for attention and lost in a land that reality forgot And what meaning do you expect your delusional selfimportant statements of unknowing inexperienced opinion to have with us What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tinyfisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat spinning rabidly in a circle waiting for the bite of the snake You are a waste of flesh You have no rhythm You are ridiculous and obnoxious You are the moralsize

Quasar stupid Your writing has to be a troll Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know Im sorry I cant go on This is an epiphany of stupid for me After this you may not hear from me again for a while I dont have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia or any of the rest of this drivel Duh The only thing worse than your logic is your manners I have snipped away most of what you wrote because well it didnt really say anything Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful I mean really stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective Maybe later in life after you have learned to read write spell and count you will have more success True these are rudimentary skills that many of

29 August 2006 UTC  Whatever the flight should be called depends on what criteria are used  If one goes by what the tickets read and what the gate agents and flight attendants announced the flight is Delta Flight 5191 or if you want to be real technical something very similar to Delta Flight 5191 operated by Comair for Delta Connection  However if one goes by how the pilots and air traffic controllers referred to the flight then it is Comair Flight 191 their actual words would have been Comair 191  Thus far the news media has called it Comair Flight 5191 probably for two reasons  One the flight was called 5191 everywhere that wasnt behind the scenes and two Delta wants to make it clear that the flight wasnt operated by Delta but was instead operated by Comair  Therefore one winds up with Comair Flight 5191 which works but isnt really quite accurate  Alex  0735,0.0

As the nominator I want to thank you for taking the time to do an indepth review of the article  I was guilty of sinking in unsigned responses to some of your comments in order to communicate progress  The article was renominated in September after three intensive days of full time effort to address all of the concerns from the prior GA review which was summarily rejected without any interaction  I thought that a featured article should certainly meet GA criteria and we designated the article as the August 2010 Wikiproject Universities collaboration of the month  The result was an improved article including many new footnotes mostly to source the fact that the notable alumni actually attended Cornell To give the collaboration a valid end point I nominated the article for GA and renominated it after addressing the listed concerns not aware of the defects that you uncovered  Because the GA queue is months long there was a peer review between the second GA nomination and your review although that review ended up mostly focusing on images  There was no intent to shop for some yes man Again thank you for your time,0.0

Post 2001 bikes   Its unclear whether the gentlemens agreement is still in effect Im also unsure if MV Agusta Aprilia or BMW ever considered themselves bound by it Ive added some of the restricted 186 mph nominal bikes but more need to be added Ive put in the BMW S1000RR as the new record holder based on a test at Bonneville and a number of vague claims that it went significantly over 186 mph Id like to see better sources on that  Im not totally sure what to make of the results from MCN     The numbers they give for various bikes dont state in a straightfoward way whether they tested a restricted bike a derestricted bike or if the bike was never restricted in the first place  Ultimate Motorcycling is taking dictation from BMWs Gary Orr owner of a dealership that the bike reached 196 totally stock Other sources seem to kind of support this but Id be happier if it was more independent Is the top speed on the S1000RR governed or isnt it What about other bikes  If I change the text to say The 2008 BMW S1000RR has exceeded the 186 mph limit but there has been no commentary as to what this means with respect to the gentlement agreement is that synthesis or original research   Id like to take a conservative approach and not accept a single claim that a bike reached a record speed and settle on a minimum speed that multiple sources agree on But Im not sure what criteria to use The alternative is to throw all claims in there and let the reader sort it out,0.0

Regarding the Harvest page   Hello Moe Epsilon  Wow looks like you were very busy editing the Harvest page  You referred edit readers to WikipediaNonfree content criteria items 3a and 8  Thank you for the reference  Regarding 3a  I agree that I went way beyond minimal use although I will say that this was without knowing of the 10 nonfree content rules  My question is does this mean that you needed to remove all album cover images and music samples  When I added the images I was using The Beatles article as a reference  Looking at it now I see that The Beatles Discography is without images although the main article still contains music samples  Does minimal use mean No use referring to there being no images at all on the Harvest page  Why is showing album cover art excessive  I have a feeling Im asking a common question  Regarding 8 significance  Is the discography considered a list  I would assume so  I guess this would be why no image photo or song sample is allowed within it  I would think this rule alone would suffice for removing all of the images I had put in the article since they were all within the Discography section  Would it be acceptable to create a separate section for music samples as in the Beatles article  If so how many music samples would be allowed  25 as in that article  I would really appreciate you responding to this post  I would like to know what you think  And I would also like to find out if any of the imagessamples I uploaded are salvageable  This would save me time in reuploading if they are  Thanks for your time and efforts in editing,0.0

Zabadab there is no conspiracy here Yes I know the guys at the company Frankly I think you are close to breaking the COI rules of not harassing me and have already broken the revealing the identity of the editor rule My fault for using my name That should probably illustrate I am not trying to hide something here  Dismissing the 451 Groups reports and other trade magazine articles as not true sources is a bit harsh Of course some of the links are press releases for the obvious reason that when a company asserts something publicly it usually comes in the form of a press release  The definition of conflict of interest is trying to advance a particular interest other than improving Wikipedia It does not mean being involved with the organization about which one is writing One can very easily contribute in a fair and neutral manner to a company to which she is associated I am trying to help improve Wikipedia by adding valuable email archiving a market I know something about information That started with Jatheon Note someone just added mimecast I plan to help improve that entry too currently quite advertisingoriented There are others too  smarsh datacove etc  that I would like to add to wikipedia  I am trying to collaborate here but frankly I am feeling unfairly attacked,0.0

More advanced explanations of the term  Carl Humphries writes the following about the great George Shearings locked hands piano technique in the section Listening Guide PostBebop Jazz his book The Piano Handbook Backbeat  2002  GEORE SHEARING who also played AfroCuban jazz and who was born blind developed the infamous locked hands approach to jazz piano   In Humphries glossary he defines the term locked hands as being  A pianistic technique used in jazz whereby the hands are allowed to move in parallel through a sequence of block chords permitting a melody to be harmonised on the spot without having to attend to the details of voiceleading  The website  defines locked hands this way  During the 1940s and 50s several pianists developed ways of playing chords melodies with both hands known as locked hands andor block chords  Two charastics of this approch influenced jazz players 1 The seperation sic  of the left hand from the pulse  2 The use of the lefthand voicing to color the melody notes In its basic form the lockedhands technique requires the right hand to play a closedposition voicing below the melody note while the left hand doubles the melody note an octave lower  The pianist must decide how to harmonize each melody note several options are available  Each melody note can be harmonized with 1 Notes from the prevailing harmony 2 Notes from the prevailing harmony on most chord tones and passing chords inserted on nonchord tones 3 Notes from the prevailing harmony on chord tones and diminished seventh chords on nonchord tones   The website  defines locked hands as being among other piano techniques this  Lockedhands mode This block chord technique was pioneered by Milt Buckner and perfected by George Shearing It also exploits the power of octaves with the chord being played within an octave and the jazz melody being doubled on the octave notes that enclose the chord Usually the left hand plays only the bottom octave note of the chord with the right hand playing most of the chord as well as the top octave note It is called the lockedhands mode because the hands are literally locked together when playing in this mode This mode is particularly well suited for the rich lowermiddle range of the grand piano a range Bill is especially fond of   Many Wiki authors dont bother to Google or do further research before they write a stub article like this one  Obviously a single definition taken from just one book is all they need  The Internet is a magnificent research tool more Wikipedia authors should take the time to make use of it,0.0

2006 UTC  Hi Jorgenumata I liked all the additions you have made I myself have worked in metals on the physics side so I can add some things But actually for the overall structure I think it would be useful to discuss some of the ways that MD is used in different fields on the talk page so that we can incorporate the different uses of MD more fully Most people are focused on their on field and dont see outside it me included so it is kind of hard to incorporate all the different things into one article The merge discussion with MM is an example Metals cannot be modelled by force fields They are completely incompatible with the force field view of molecules and from reading the MM page MM only uses force fields So it seems impossible to merge the articles Anyway enoough of my blabbing The things that I am interested in knowing are whathow MD is used in different fields  Fluidaerodynamics Do fluid dynamics  aerodynamics people use the billiardball approximation of atoms to model fluids and are these methods considered molecular dynamics if they consider each atom individually Metals We dont use force fields Generally TBSMA or equivalent is the least accuratemost empirical that can be used Tightbinding and ab initio are far more common Anyway I can add a lot of metals things myself so dont need much input here Semiconductors Again force fields are not used However requires very different approximations to metal simulations Again I can add stuff to the article on these Chemists What exactly do chemists study Are the chemical reactions always studied within a solvent or are they studied on isolated chemical compounds Is it always important to correctly model the temperature and pressure or are these secondary considerations in chemical MD simulations Bio Similar to chemistry are temperature and pressure important Do proteins get modelled within the context of a solvent or are conformations studied on the basis of a single protein molecule with no external interactions So Ill try to add some metals and semiconductor things to the article but I dont want to break the chembio side Will come back in maybe a week and try to do some additions  0909 21 November,0.0

Hi RyanGerbil10  Thank you for explaining the block placed on my account  I have reviewed both WPstalk and WPNPA policies and I do not believe the actions you speak of are in violation of either of these policies nor do I think that they warrant a 24h block not even a warning  Can you please clarify both the violation and why you felt that a 1day block was appropriate  Specifically Im not sure if you noticed but I only edited two user pages  hardly following users around so you say and definitely NOT stalking  I also responded whenever Aeon1006 was talking about me specifically which every user probably has a prima facie right to do  Finally where was the personal attack on Aeon  I merely stated my case and I think I provided ample support  I would think that all of these things would barely warrant a warning let alone a block of such duration  I understand that you have been previously acquainted with Aeon1006  Im wondering if you wouldnt mind asking a second administrator to review this ruling if you dont think that you can be 100 impartial Thank you very much for your consideration,0.0

Does this sound like the type of technology you want to keep from public knowledge  This article sounds like an advertisement  Did you read the second paragraph  The second paragraph sounds more like the description of an academic study at a university  And the first paragraph sounds more a like a parts list  Is a parts list inappropriate  Theres a parts list after the words In order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work it must have several components to integrate it into the bodys function in the article at   The parts list sounds good at  and I believe a parts list also sounds good at     Sure the page hasnt been cited  It doesnt need to be cited  Did you read it  The article is like talking about bread and cheese except the article calls it a cheese sandwich  Why is that  Biometrics is common knowledge just like bread is common knowledge  The level two headline Function at  could be more comprehensive  I am surprised that behavior analysis was not included as a subcategory under the level two headline Function in this article  This behavior analysis subcategory should have a link to   Both  and  should have links to   Demographic maps are common knowledge just like cheese is common knowledge  There should be a link from  to  as well  You put bread and cheese together what do you get  A cheese sandwich  You hook up a biometric system as an information source to a demographic mapping system what do you get  A biodemometer  Doesnt sound like something that is worth of a separate article  See if you can find anything like it at  or    How is this measuring instrument any different from any of the indented links at   It is a unique measuring device just like all of the other measuring devices on this page  There should be a link to  from   Do the links at  sound like advertisements too  The measuring instruments linked to  are sold in stores  Some of the pictures of measuring devices on these links are actually of brand name products    Article starts here Biodemometers are made of three basic parts  First biodemometers have a biometric system that measures peoples body language and expressions  These measuring systems may consist of security cameras  such as those used in public surveillance systems or aircraft or spacecraft video  Second biodemometers have a computer that identifies and interprets specific body movement types  and analyzes the geographical distribution and density of these body language types  Third biodemometers have a console that displays a database or map of the body language types in populations and how they change    Biodemometers are used in the field of biodemometrics  Biodemometrics is an interdisciplinary field  Biodemometrics draws information from the fields of Physiology and Psychology to characterize body language types  Biodemometrics draws information from the field of Mathematics to analyze and sort body language measurements  and to analyze the geographic distribution and density of body language types  Information from the field of Mathematics is also used to identify aerial camera angles that sample larger population sizes and detect a sufficient range of the vertical components of peoples body movements  Biodemometrics draws information from the field of Computer and Information Science to collect and analyze information about the body movement types of populations accurately and efficiently  For example programs that bioauthenticate people can be used to prevent duplicate measurements of people from being taken computer memory providing  Also information from Computer and Information Science can be used to keep track of sources of information when data is pooled from many different sources  Biodemometrics draws information from the fields of Sociology History Biodemography Economics and Political Science to correlate changes in peoples body language to local indicators and factors of population development  and to classify population types according to their body language  Biodemometrics also draws information from the field of Cartography to represent numerical measurements of peoples body language how these measurements change in general and in relation to specific indicators and factors of population development and qualitative interpretations of numerical measurements of peoples body language,0.0

May 2006 UTC   Ah now this is a very interesting question especially having in mind a curious concept in the unwritten constitution of the UK that of the Crown and royal prerogative  through which ministers including the Prime Minister derive their executive authority The Prime Minister acting in his capacity as a crown officer can ask for a nuclear strike However the Prime Minister unlike the President of the US is not a commissioned officer in HM Forces and therefore cannot order any serving member of the armed forces to do anything and require them to obey Instead she will ask the Chief of the Defence Staff who is a commisioned officer to order the launch This in theory provides a safeguard against a particularly despotic Prime Minister going rogue and ordering a nuclear strike on their own In practice however it is unlikely this distinction would be observed  especially in a crisis situation likely to require nuclear retaliation Further complications arise due to submarine based Trident weapons and the envelopes onboard This whole topic is explored in much more detail in the book The Secret State  Britain and the Cold War by Professor Peter Watkins   1607 19,0.0

East Jerusalem only existed as a Jordanian municipality unit so there is no point in trying to have an Israeli equivalent According to Jerusalem municipality website the total population of Jerusalem in 2003 comprised 693200 people of which 464500 670 were Jews and 228700 330 were nonJews Since most nonJewish residents are concentrated in the eastern part of the city and the count of 410000 people refers to the 194867 Jordanian municipality borders that would mean that only about 52 of east Jerusalem is populated by nonJews and western Jerusalem is populated only by 280000 persons This sounds highly implausible,0.0

Sudhir I too sometimes wish that wikipedia pages could be frozen in the versions that I like but alas wikipedia rules and ethos stand in the way  More seriously I assume you are referring to this version of the page that was last edited by you I havent read that version completely but the Early Life section in it was largely sourced to  Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya By Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya Dhusar Bhargava Memorial Charitable Trust Regd Rekmo Press New Delhi I havent seen this work but the listed author suggests that it is a community history which for the same reason as ML Bhargavas book is deprecated on wikipedia  Anokha Aarohi by Kranti Trivedi This is a work of fiction   Please take a look at WPHISTRS for why we prefer academic histories and modern scholarly works in writing wikipedia articles That is not going to change anytime soon and I dont want to give you false hope that the Early life section can be edited to resemble the version it was on Sep 22 last year,0.0

Unblock Request Fuck you unblock me   unblockHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE  It had been six years since we had graduated from college and for the first time since graduation all three of us were together again From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable  Having returned to my cozy semisecluded home in the suburbs we all sat in the living room sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives With the exceptions of the location  a house  and the presence of alcohol it could have been any of our final two years of college together The three of us tightknit friendswithbenefits sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together Then Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad now they were muchwelcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend  As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justines skin and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulderlength brown hair As when we were in college together she wore virtually no makeup just a thin gloss upon her lips  an enticing strawberry flavor as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening  and red fingernails Her red dress was indeed elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the welltoned thigh The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes Surprisingly however she wore hoop earrings something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe  The conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other I took the opportunity to once again study Beth and was equally impressed While noticeably shorter than Justine Beth was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research As in college Beth preferred the color black for her outfits a somewhattight sweater formfitting slacks and a pair of low heels Four tiny earrings adorned each ear plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril Beths black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine  It felt so good to be in their presence once again Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy but for now I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa  The intimacy began when we finally went to bed together I was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder An arm wrapped around each of them I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest dipped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed caressed my stiffening manhood My eyes closed I reveled in their touches inherently familiar yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time  No words were needed And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me I smiled to myself in the darkness having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters But eventually their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep I stayed awake a little longer immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life  I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee faint yet unmistakable Justine was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while Beth and I held each other as she slept The feel of her pajamacovered breasts against me was a welcome sensation as it had been over a year since I had last even hugged a woman Simply waking up in the morning and not finding myself alone in bed was a tremendous thrill in itself walking up with Beth in my arms made the morning extremely special for me  Gently I kissed her forehead and she stirred in my arms She was clearly lost in that odd hazy phase between sleep and consciousness as she nudged me to my back and lay upon me Underneath the covers I slowly caressed her as I kissed the top of her head A few minutes later as Beth finally awoke and lifted her head to give me a semiconscious smile Justine nudged open the bedroom door and carried three mugs of coffee on a tray  Just like old times seeing you two like that Justine quipped with a smile Beth simply giggled softly awakening further as I held her a little tighter  Deciding we wanted bagels for breakfast I headed out into the snow and to a familyowned bagel shop a few blocks away When I returned my two beautiful guests were still upstairs and I was not at all surprised to open the bedroom door and find that Justines sleep shirt had been removed she knelt upon the bed straddling Beths waist as each woman lovingly touched each other  Just like old times seeing you two like that I parroted with a smile Justine simply laughed softly her eyes inviting me to join them While it was indeed tempting I knew that they both would want  and need  some intimate time alone together so despite my growing erection I simply approached the bed long enough to give each of them a gentle kiss to the cheek before retreating from the bedroom closing the door to allow them their privacy  As I sat in the dining room with a bagel and a newspaper I eventually heard Justines beautiful cry and instantly knew that I had made the correct decision in leaving my two longtime friends alone upstairs Simply imaging what Beth had possibly done to produce such an exquisite sound was arousing in itself and I found my hand stroking slowly at the front of my jeans  After my guests had eaten while Justine showered Beth and I retired to the living room Sitting on the sofa with the stunning young woman straddling my lap I gazed deep into her eyes as she gently stroked my chest through my sweatshirt After a few moments our lips naturally drew together the slow kiss at once warm and electrifying  My hands wandered from Beths shoulders to her chest squeezing her breasts gently and feeling her contented moan I slowly began to unbutton her pajama shirt as the kiss continued baring her torso to my view once she leaned back from me and helped me to remove the black garment  Bite me hard she requested breathily just like you use to do  Rising up on her knees Beth leaned toward me offering a breast to my lips My hands cupping her lower cheeks I took the proffered nipple into my mouth sucking gently like a newborn baby for a few moments before trapping the lengthening bud between my teeth and tugging gently The change in breathing above me signaled that I was doing exactly as she wanted as she perhaps needed and I tugged a bit harder then a bit harder then a bit harder  Then I bit her firmly at the base of the nipple Her hands stiffened at the back of my head and the hiss above me was unmistakable My own hands moving up her back to hold her in place I bit her again harder holding the bite for several seconds before releasing her breast from my mouth For a moment I looked fondly upon the markings left behind by my teeth then switched to her other breast and bit my longtime friend again the soft groan evidence that I was indeed hurting her  With one arm still wrapped around her back my free hand moved between her thighs and began to stroke her sex through the pajama bottoms and panty she wore I felt Beth shudder as I bit her again  harder  and stroked her with a little more force I continued biting her and stroking her enjoying her sounds of hurt and delight drawing the sweet nectar from her so that I could feel it upon my fingers despite the two layers between my hand and her sex Eventually however I stopped biting her alternately simply kissing and suckling each breast I stroked her with more force as she moved against my hand until finally her orgasm overtook her her hands clutching my head to her chest and her powerful heavy breaths irregular and full of desire and thankfulness  As Beth calmed I kissed her between her breasts directly over her heart and she lowered herself so we could share a warm kiss  You two make a nice picture  Blushing and giggling softly as we held each other Beth and I both turned toward Justine for a moment then Beth,1.0

STRONGLY OPPOSE There is no argument here as the US Navy spells TOPGUN only one way TOPGUN Top Gun is the name of the movie and was registered as a trademark by the studio At first they tried to trademark the name TOPGUN but the Navy said NO As far as established publishing practice goes thats baloney Therere many exceptions to this socalled practice so that is a nonstarter All caps is perfectly fine as is  1311 17 August 07,0.0

Hazel Eye Myth  The description of hazel eyes says theyre green and brown either colour could be dominant and can also contain gold this description is incorrect true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour basically light brown which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell hence the word hazel however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green either on the outskirts andor mixed in with the gold when observed in directsun light but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes   The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multicoloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation However in Europe the origin of light eyes  hazelnuts the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color hazel eyes  golden light brown colour The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multicoloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold andor light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in directsun light but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand  As for green and brown eyes theyre well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia brown around the pupil but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown  Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are                    Here are some sources backing up my statement   defines it as a light golden brown colour after a hazelnut   states hazel eyes are light brown or yellowish brown    shows a pure hazel eye big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right    puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown central heterochromia under the green category    shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown    states the North American misconception and the trueoriginal European definition while showing examples of various sources numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude   states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut the fruit of the hazel bushtree that grows in Europe   shows an optometrists opinionexperience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and provides sources backing up his statement  Hazel Eye Picture On The Right  The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes as it is blue with central heterochromia brown around the pupil The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately i propose one of the following pictures be shown in its place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour,0.0

Important clarification to add Processor vs Core Microsoft definitions   Page shall contain the exact definition of what a processor is microsoftly speaking Indeed this concept is quite blur if we refer to the numerous pages from different Microsoft web sites  For instance at  we can find Windows 2003 Server Standard x64 R2 64 bits  4way symmetric multiprocessing SMP support  Other example for the same Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition at   memorybound applications that do not require more than four processors  supports up to 32 GB of RAM on 1 to 4way servers  Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition supports up to four CPUs on one server  If we refer to Wikipedia  multiprocessor architecture or multicore processor are both SMP architecture Thus by speaking sometimes about 4 processors support sometimes about 4way SMP support Microsoft confuses us all Coming to a Quadri 4cores based server 16 SMP this leads to go from a Standard edition 4 processors support to a DataCenter edition 4x416 SMP support thus raising the license price as for no less than 700,0.0

Broad search simply for the definition Heres another approach To make sure my research isnt tainted by cherrypicking I typed a neutral term into google Definition Beat Generation Here are the defnitions that I found going through four google pages only excluding repition and irrelevant sites These are hardly formal sources but the purpose of this exercise is to show that confusion about this term and how it is to be used is a genuine issue Simply saying the one definition is the majority without putting effort into supporting the claim is not a valid way to prove a point  Sources that place subculturegeneration first and group of writers second     Sources that place group of writers first subculturegeneration second and also mention artists     Sources that only mention the group of writers not the subculturegeneration   Sources that only mention the group of writers not the subculturegeneration but also mention artists   Sources that only mention the subculturegeneration not the group of writers           If this method genuinely points to a majority opinion then clearly this would be it  Iffy     Now for serious sources I encountered when typing the same term into Google Book search  Lawlor here identifies the exact problem I identified as being the major problem with this page A page like this which strives for accuracy should acknowledge that there is no set definition no majority no consus on how the term should be used  Several key questions are central to the study of the Beat Generation The first is whether a Beat Generation actually exists If the Beat Generation consists of Kerouac Ginsberg Burroughs and a few others then the Beat Generation does not exist because a generation cannot be based on just a few people On the other hand if the Beat Generation includes dozens and dozens of artists including not only writers but also dancers painters sculptors musicians then the Beat Generation does not exist because the concept is too loose too vague  William Lawlor Beat culture lifestyles icons and impact ABCCLIO 2005  ISBN 1851094008 9781851094004 pg 78  For this one there may be some confusion by what Kerouac means by people who had been beaten down since that could apply to either the small group or the broader subculture However Morgan provides the same definition I presented earlier in which Kerouac identifies it as certain members of the generation that came of age after World War II who affected detachment etc Its conceivable that one might argue Kerouac meant his group of friends by certain people but from many other sources he meant the broader subculture open for debate but lets have that debate instead of blindly dismissing without evidence to support counterclaims Heres the quote from Morgan  Once the press began to identify those writers collectively as the Beat Generation some within the group began to struggle with a definition for the word beat Since it was Jack Kerouac who had originally coined the phrase he was asked repeatedly what he meant by it Initially he said that the Beat Generation was composed of people who had been beaten down worn out and exhausted As time passed he refined his definition to emphasize the beatific blessed or sympathetic qualities of his generation  Bill Morgan William Morgan The Typewriter Is Holy The Complete Uncensored History of the Beat Generation Simon and Schuster 2010 ISBN 1416592423 9781416592426   Theres more but Im out of time,0.0

US States name game is a terrible example   Due to the limited number of states this game would be over almost as quickly as it started  Why  Consider Over 40 21 out of 50 of states end in the letter A  Of the four states that start in A three Alabama Alaska Arizona also end in A and the fourth Arkansas would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota both of which end in A and thus youd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape  This loop is almost completely unavoidable  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop Almost as many 18 states start with a letter that no other state ends in  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them  Of these states we also have the only state ending in a T Connecticut and the only state ending in an H Utah  Thus you can add Hawaii Tennessee and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up The only way you wont end up stuck in the endless Aloop is if you somehow land on one of the five states Delaware New Hampshire Tennessee unlikely as seen above Kentucky and New Jersey that end in a letter no other state starts with at which point the game would be over There are numerous other pitfalls consider Ohio  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio or go to Oklahoma thus falling into the Aloop or you could go to Oregon  From there you could go to Nebraska Nevada North Carolina and North Dakota all falling again into the Aloop  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey both game enders or New Mexico which just takes you back where you started or finally New York  New York then leads to Kentucky ending the game or Kansas falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the Aloop yet again Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example  Theres more of them for one thing though still quite a few ending or starting in A and again a large number of which both start and end in A so the loop still exists but its larger and easier to get out of  Also most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country so youd be less likely to get stuck and there arent so many of them which could never appear  A few exist  cant think of any countries ending in J V or Z  sorry Jordan Vietnam Venezuela and Zimbabwe probably more but Id have to do a more thorough search  Anyhow maybe Im crazy for noticing stuff like this but I thought it was worth mentioning,0.0

I disagree with you Maudoodi was a big cause of the 1953 violent AntiAhmadiyya riots and this certainly makes him militant if not outright terrorist  I dont see any majority here that is arguing otherwise but at the same time majority alone does not make something correct we need to see the facts Can you provide reference to Maudoodis linage Just because someone comes up with a bunch of names is not a proof of anything  I appreciate your desire to discuss this issue and also the fact that you do not consider yourself biased It is however a fact that mainstream Muslims are short of heroes lately in the last 600 years and there has been a need to come up with some and further post 911 there is need to rewrite history to show them less militant then they actually were for reasons of political corrections Whether this is done consciously like users like Siddiqui or sub consciously it is wrong either way Your changes are unacceptable as they practically deny the element of militancy,0.0

Theories in science fiction Parallel universes resolution   I think that the parallel universes resolution should not be put under the science fiction catagory There are current physics theories that suggest at least at a mathematical level the possibility of parallel universes One such theory is Stringtheory   More accuretly it is Mtheory Mtheory A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within the 11dimensional extension of string theory known as Mtheory In Mtheory our universe and others are created by collisions between membranes in an 11dimensional space Unlike the universes in the quantum multiverse these universes can have completely different laws of physicsanything may be possible   This is also talked about in a PBS Nova special entitled The Elegant Universe  And those videos are full of scientists and professors from various established scientific communities,0.0

Further Recherche   Boris Beresowski          who founded a party with two other people Sergej Juschenkow and Wladimir Golowljow and who was a voter pro Putinvotecontrahent Iwan Rybkin in 2004    had to realize that both other party founders Sergej Juschenkow and Wladimir Golowljow were murdered by the Kreml or by Beresowsky himself  Boris Beresowski was a TVManager so he choosed the slow public death of Alexander Litvinenko to destroy the image of Putin    Though Alexander Litvinenko was doing a recherche to the death aof Anna Politkovskaja      The recherche has to find out now if Boris Beresowski has a contamination of Polonium 210 or  which forces within russia do not want a modern Kremel with  and of course why Anna Politkovskaja was murdered by the Kremel Too many death peaople Alexander Litvinenko Sergej Juschenkow and Wladimir Golowljow and Anna Politkovskaja  If Boris Berezovsky would die as well Vladimir Putin would be in hard conflicts   As Ivan Rybkin is a founder of the conservative party      and a good Friend of Boris Beresowski both contrahents of Putin the motives of the death of Alexander Litvinenko maybe found in the relationsships of Ivan Rybkin to the Russian federation      Secretary of the federation is 2001  2004 Wladimir Ruschailo he has to be asked as well towards the topics because his period ended as well with the beginning of putin  Ivan Rybkin was the securitysecretary of the russian federation and as well specialsecretary for the Tschetschenienwar He was called Mr Consens so he made peace with them in a mute way  the opposite of Putin a loud war And this was as well the topic of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko the war against Tschetschenien which should be strategic product of burning the house downPutin in their eyes  So the real focus is the nowerdays work of Ivan Rybkin,0.0

The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is British  Irish Isles Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the UK as a protected and supported territory Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the UK  Did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term    Completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles Place names reflect current realities thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople    A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction the only islands which are now Greek islands are those within the jurisdiction of Greece if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term but rather than an ethnic or geographical one then the same argument or even a better one can be made of Greek the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece eg southern Italy Sicily turkey Armenia etc and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated Greek are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish   Thus you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British,0.0
Hi Tom  Funny one    I dont see the note below that you refer to  As far as insertion of the info in the lead sentence see the note above our conversation for my thoughts  The Wiki policy that I refer to which is the focus of some people who focus more on their view of required format than they do on what is AWK no doubt largely causes this problem  I expect you dont have a problem with mention that someone is Latvian say in the lead  and do not view that as AWK  And as you and our colleague in the above discussion point out it was seem nonAWK to say Jewish or Jew either before or after the reference to Latvian  But where some peoples reading of the Wiki format direction stops us from doing this we are necessarily forced into a more awkward presentation  What you say looks feels very awkward  If I want to satisfy the formatismostimportant people and I want to satisfy the AWKismostimportant people and still wish to reflect simply in the text that someone is Jewish with no greater emphasis than mention of the fact that they are Latvian I find that at times this can be challenging depending on whether the interested parties wish to make the article better or just like deleting or reverting the info without putting it in a form that works for them and others  There are I expect one or two other groups of editors out there  One group just wishes to delete mention of the fact generally that people are Jewish  Another group wishes to delete mention of the fact that people are Jewish if they believe it will help  or hurt  the image of Jews that they wish to propogate  These two group I expect do not indicate what their true interest is but cloak their arguments with psuedorationale argumentation  Personally while I personally support reflection that people are Jewish especially in the area of sportspeople I would not delete such a reference where the person in question is not one that the Jews might be proud to call their own  If it notable as measured  and this is important  by reflection of the fact in multiple sources that are reliable and not connected then I have no problem with good or bad people being identified as Jews if that is the case  the same as I have no problem with them being identified as Latvians  I appreciate your comment that you are not trying to ethnically cleanse articles as you put it  I just had some people delete a category that I created Jewish figure skaters  It was deleted despite the fact that attempts to delete Jewish sportspeople and Jewish fencers with largely the same arguments recently by the same people did not result in deletion  That is now up for deletion review  If you could give me any thoughts as to your thinking on how to address this issue that would be great as well  Cheers  Have a great weekend,0.0

This is a kind offer indeed and I would urge other editors to take it up if they feel they can do so However Im not sure I want to come back in and try to work the article into something reasonable making sense of the storys historical place in the burgeoning alAqsa intifada of late 2000 while avoiding going overboard on context The latter has only been abused in Paras 123 and 4 of the lead and everywhere else throughout the article at the moment  and it would be tricky to do a proper narrative under almost any circumstances  First of all I would have to strip out nearly everything about the quite trivial controversy especially because of the BLP issues along with many of the terrible sources being used Only then might the remainder be useful as the basis of an article that would do justice to the project The article has got to have the firm application of policy first with Haaretz and JPost and the Daily Mirror in Commentary Magazine and OBL out  I suppose we have to have Karsenty and the hoax theory mentioned somewhere  lets confine it to proper encyclopaedic use of the actual French RS translation here Remember hes been convicted of defamation so this is his second bite of the cherry and he gets lucky In French the nearest Karsenty gets to any support is lexamen des rushes ne permet plus décarter les avis des professionnels entendus au cours de la procédure  that his views cannot be set aside on the basis of the film That is ludicrously different from support for the hoax theory Which in any case is very much a sideshow to this story Have a look  the French report of the court case mentions two points raised by Karsenty right at the end and very nearly brushes them off as quibbles Id be fairly sure that everything from Shahaf can come out he doesnt need mentioning If we have to have anything from him atall I provisionally propose the early theory that was on German television that a Palestinian standing next to the cameraman shot alDurrah dead from the other side of the street I dont know why Shahaf abandoned a semicredible theory for the contradictory he wasnt shot and isnt dead hoax theory which is what he has desperately been trying to persuade us of ever since,0.0

The text of the article could have been taken from Tudjman era Croatian propaganda press The consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality or revalue the widely accepted view of Croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased Some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing particularly the plight of the citys inhabitants of Serbian nationality  about half of the total number  in the city subject to Croatian military rule or the very existence thereof parts of the text are clearly selfcontradictory the Croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed yet they still manage to down 20 warplanes and full of dubious propaganda cliches the backbone of JNA was broken at Vukovar One does not need to be an expert on war in the Balkans to note these shortcomings Naturally this does not mean that we should subscribe to the Serbian propaganda of the time  an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from ICTY proceedings from well known western reporters present at or near the scene Misha Glenny and from other sources Actually merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this    Numbers  We need sources and references for the numbers,0.0

Some of this discussion seems to have gotten a little heated but I think the main goal remains the same of having a good encylopedia and having good articles within it The subjects involved both MHFM and the others mentioned  may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theologicalphilsophical schools of which they represent The sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of Vatican II on the largest single religious denomination on the planet and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept Vatican II and those who refuse and resist it such as the Society of Saint Pius X but still hold that Francis is a legitimate Pope despite his endorsement of Vatican II Due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory Vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post Vatican II Catholicism and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as What will Amanda Bynes tweet next it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite But it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought Surely if wikipedia can have an article on every piece of music made by Paris Hilton we can find a way to capture the interactions and debates between schools of thought that will continue for generations to come   It is Wikipedia practice to use a persons published thoughts as a legitimate source that can be cited as a quotation about that persons opinionie a persons tweets can be quoted in that persons wikiarticle citing the twitter pages url even though they are were not printed in full by a media organization It would seem that such an approach could be used here citing Ibranyi by quoting his online work as an indication of his own thought as long as an encylopedic manner was maintained,0.0

Trade  There are rumors that Johnson could be traded before the 2007 trade deadline The marlins are in desperate need of a premier centerfielder and if rookie centerfielder alejandro de aza struggles a trade could likely happen Johnson who is sidelined for two months with a nerve injury was lucky he did not receive any damage as he would have likely missed the entire 2007 season and likely been traded Johnson is considered one of the next premier pitchers but many question his fatigue issues Due to his size 67 ft tall and over 250 lbs Johnson suffers from great fatigue that greatly diminishes his play and puts him at risk of injury Because the shear force of the balls he throws and size johnsons dominance in a game usually begins to diminish some where around the 4th or 5th inning and the effects of fatigue  become present last season then manager girardi came under fire for letting Johnson pitch after 4 shutout innings after a rain delay rather than put in an relief pitcher Johnson was shortly pulled from the game for poor play and injury and the marlins ended up losing Johnson afterwards was diagnosed with an elbow injury Even when johnson does return there is still a great risk of reinjury and poor play and given the marlins crop of pitching prospects and need for a centerfielder johnson could find himself in a new uniform by the end of the year,0.0

Ed it is not about perception it is what it is Disco is a subgenre of rock with primary influence from soul and funk music which they themselves came from rhythm and bluesrock Disco is more like uptempo soul or pop funk whichever way you want to look at it although such simple terms will be targeted what genre label isnt Discos real strong roots lie in the twist crazes of the early 60s spearheaded by Chubby Checker Discotheques played soul records like Motown records by Joey Dee  the Starliters the Archies Martha  The Vandellas and even psychedelic funk such as Sly  The Family Stones seminal Dance To the Music as well as other rock dance crazes And yes Im very well aware of classical electronic music The reason why there was an antidisco backlash is the result of a number of factors including racism against gays and blacks the saturation of disco singles on radio and in the market etc It is a complex issue If you look back at articles during that time period especially from Rolling Stone magazine those factors are clearly highlighted The Disco Demilition Night crowd and its DJ are mostly ignorants straight up but that is a different story Most of them dont even know what rock n roll is nor its roots But to be fair some funk enthusiasts and others from the black community have vilified the genre as well If youd like to know more we can chat somewhere,0.0

Deficiency in the article  It seems to me that theres a major deficiency in this article which is that its not made clear what the connection is between a rotation matrix and the geometric operation of rotation  this connection being that if you premultiply a rotation matrix by a column vector then the result is another column vector that is just a rotation of the first  Okay it is stated eventually but not until the geometry section and there only in the abstract language of linear algebra putting the main point of rotation matrices out of reach of anyone except those who should know it already  Im hesitating to jump in and revise it as Im kind of new to linear algebra but will probably go ahead and take a crack at it eventually if no one with more expertise wants to step up,0.0

First of all I find it disturbing that the is an element of symbol wasnt showing up for JKeck since there seems to be nothing irregular about the way it was entered looks like it came from the Math and logic collection in the rolldown menu from the edit pages which gives  If you have this problems you are probably missing loads of symbols in math articles since this is the privileged way to represent them You could try to replace the symbol by  giving  or by clicking on the symbol in Math and logic yourself which might resolve some coding issue to see it that works better TeX code in WP produces images which avoids such problems but looks bad in inline formulas however much the formulas themselves are of superior quality If this is really a problem of your local installation the solution cannot be to change the WP articles  As for problems understanding I think you really dont need to understand the axiom of choice unless you are a mathematician interested in foundations In physics you will never come about a situation where a result depends on the axiom of choice because it talks about provability in set theory only Probably the opening sentence should make this clear For any reasonable collection of nonempty sets one could encounter in real life a choice function is easily found without use of axioms and this is the reason that the axiom seems reasonable but in mathematics it gets applied in highly abstract and complicated situations where the real world justification for the existence of choice functions no longer suffices,0.0
Youre missing something with Russells SECOND hypothesis and Radzs reply  Russells analysis was premised on Majoranas theory while Radzs countertheory was based on Le Sage  So you cant just say that Russell did away with the shielding possibility completely  You need to show some error in Radzs approach  The paper appeared initially in a standard Russian peerreviewed journal but the possibility of an error remains  Can you put your finger on it  If not then give up your argument since youve spotted me inertia now  Russells THIRD hypothesis is still in play of course as well as some more recent suggestions,0.0

Exactly why this article should be deleted  Since some editors have deplorable difficulty understanding as ITAQALLAH laments but on the talk page never explains in detail how the content is in accordance with policy and ignores any policies that I may cite why this article deserves to be deleted I will once more explain now being very precise and exact so that you may be cleared of all doubts  The article in its postcensorsed state is in violation of WPBLP Let me quote from it   Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States and to all of our content policies especially    Neutral point of view NPOV  Verifiability  No original research  This article violates requirement number One Neutral point of view NPOV  Now for idiotic editors like those who childishly colour their usernames who will have difficulty comprehending how on earth this article violates NPOV owing to their idiocy which I hope Eugenics will fix one day let me quote section 25 from the NPOV page  Balance  When reputable sources contradict one another the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page work for balance that is describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner  It says describe the opposing viewpoints And where does this article do that  Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints it suppresses opposing viewpoints  This is why the article is biased censorsed and therefore must be deleted  I will be reinserting the PROD tag in 24 hours if no one can come up with an argument that justifies having a biased viewpoint or can explain why and how the describe the opposing viewpoints requirement is insignificant enough to be ignored,0.0

Again please see above  The listed version is not by any means necessarily the Remix version  And even if it were it wouldnt matter songs are categorized by title with remixes following not vice versa  Both the original song and Timbalands remix are covered in both infobox form and the article proper in a manner consistent with similar historic cases see for example I will Always Love You popularized by both Dolly Parton and Whitney Houston or Blue Suede Shoes which was a relatively minor Carl Perkins tune until Elvis Presley covered ityet Perkins correctly gets top billing in the article as the originator  Thats the nature of authorship  Again this has been hashed out above,0.0

Example   For example a train that weighs 1 kg moving at 500 ms and that hits a perfect steel wall where it uniformly decelerates from 500 ms to 0 ms in 02 seconds has an approximate impact force of 25000 N Thus a body which decelerates more quickly has a greater effective impact than one which decelerates more slowly  Im not doubting the calculation here but the example is a bit unusual  500 meters per second is equivalent to about 1118 miles per hour faster than a bullet train  And a 1 kg train is like a toy train or something so in my head Im imagining a toy train breaking the sound barrier and smashing into a steel wall  Im not sure what a typical train weighs maybe 50000 kg but apparently their max speed is about 50 mph or 80 kmh or 22222 ms  50000 kg  22 ms  002s  55000000 N  There Doesnt that turn into a nice number,0.0

I dont understand why you think the definition belongs only with momentumtime  the reason is pedagogical within the physics discipline  it would be a tautology to define the Joule as the amount of energy required to move a body against a force of 1 Newton the distance of 1 meter then at the same time define the Newton as 1 Joule per meter  its true but it says nothing about the quantities of the Joule or of the Newton nor anything about their dimesion  it is not like the chicken and egg we know which one comes first meter kg second come first then the Newton before the Joule the Planck force is a derived unit and will have to be the Planck unit of momentum divided by the Planck unit of time  the fact that it comes out to be the basic tension in string theory or in general relativity the force that is the conversion factor between spacetime curvature and the energy density giving rise to it or if multiplied by the fourth power of the dimensionless circular orbit speed some distance from a central body that it tells what the body would weigh at that distance all these are fine and good but they are the result of working out hypothesized physics problems they are not the definition  what if you worked out some other basic physics problem say the basic tension of a string and it came out to be 2 FP or 4 π FP  would you say that the force solutions to such are the definition of the Planck force  it doesnt matter what the system of units are once you have those 5 base units defined there is no freedom left to define the others  their definitions are purely consequential  i think you need to word things according to the most common terminology  i fixed it a little more  i inserted edit notes invisible that ask what does it mean to distribute energy over a gravitational radius and what does it mean to distribute energy over the Compton wavelength  unless you expect your encylopediac readers to know even vaguely when or where or how or why such distribution of energy is being done thus defining the rate of such distribution why say these words  also there still is no citation other than Schwartzchild radius which i did  so a reader does not think that this was all just made up you might want to include references to other stuff  i fixed the convention errors and format errors some just now  do a diff comparison to see what i did,0.0

Hi  I thought Id drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o  First of all it may be best for you to do a bit of reading starting with the Wikipedia manual of style which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written  Its not as hard to follow as it might look quite a bit of the information there probably wont be vital for you at first  Second I recommend you make a user sandbox  which is just an area you can use to practise in and to make notes in and to get things ready in  If you click this red link  that will let you create that page it gives you an edit window to start work in  Anything anywhere on the help and information pages which gives you an example try it out in your sandbox until youre familiar with it  For your article the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it  Google searches particularly in Books and Scholar will be your best friend for this  Once youve found the information the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words very important this and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from  Build in the references as you go along Im going to copy in down below this a whole heap of help on doing references which was produced by one of our best teachers   Heres another place that youll find incredibly useful  citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox between  tags you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template and youll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o  It all helps  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox make a new line and put References on it and type reflist on the next line so that you can see how your citations look as you do them  Remember to save your page often You dont want to lose your work  Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you  One last thing to keep as a motto Its better to write one good wellreferenced nicelypresented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced oneline stubs     How references work   Simple references   These require two parts  a  Chzz is 98 years old The book of Chzz Aardvark Books 2009   He likes tea   Tea website    b A section called References with the special code reflist   References  reflist   an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections  To see the result of that please look at  Edit it and check the code perhaps make a test page of your own such as  and try it out   Named references    Chzz was born in 1837  The book of Chzz Aardvark Books 2009     Chzz lives in Footown    Note that the second usage has a  and no closing ref tag This needs a reference section as above please see  to see the result   Citation templates   You can put anything you like between  and  but using citation templates makes for a neat consistent look   Chzz has 37 Olympic medals  Citation   last  Smith   first  John   title  Olympic medal winners of the 20th century   publicationdate  2001   publisher  Cambridge University Press   page  125   isbn  0521371694     Please see  to see the result  For more help and tips on that subject see  Something to make your life easier  Hi there   Ive just come across one of your articles and noticed that you had to create titles for your url links manually or were using bare urls as references  You  might want to consider using this tool  it makes your life a whole heap easier by filling in co,0.0

Robert Plants Romani roots   I see that there are some information about Plant having some Romani roots As far as I know however Plant said my mother was a gypsy where gypsy couldve meant a traveller or a a hippie  in terms of a lifestyle not ethnicity He couldve meant some Itinerant groups in Europe like for instance the Irish Travellers or maybe some Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups I know Robert Plant is from the UK and Ive heard that British people usually dont use the word gypsy when speaking about Romani people but they use it when speaking about people who lead itinerant life Any conformation that Plant used it in terms of his Romani ethnic origin,0.0

A good place to start with citation of sources are the books mentioned in the Further reading section If people were to read what has been written about the technocracy movement you will note that it does predate the publication of the study course and even predates the Technical Alliance    Also the movement was more than just Tech Inc as there was a number of technocratic organisations around in the 1930s and before William E Akins book for example mentions technocratic organisations such as the Soviet of Technicians and The New Machine Allen Raymond points out that all the elements of technocracy were in place long before technocracy came to public attention in 1933 I would suggest that everyone here actually goes back and reads some if not all of those books and uses them for references Then only put in things that can be cited   BTW Skip please check out what a blog actually is,0.0

Preceding unsigned comment added by     1117 9 June 2009  The proper way of dealing with links to your own sites is to post the link to the discussion page and say Please I think this is of interest if you agree I would like someone who isnt me to add it It is not to add it and then when it is removed add it again and again and again persistently for over a month I didnt look any further into your edit history than that Im afraid Im really surprised that there wasnt an admin complaint about your behaviour made much earlier  Blogs and free web hosts such as blogspot are interesting but for the most part are not sites that Wikipedia links to  a site needs a lot more information and credibility than a fan club with one post and no comments terribly sorry We have linked to fan sites and blogs in the past for example there are links on Wikipedia to Whedonesquecom which is both but it needs to be a big established site  though its a fan site Joss Whedon posts to Whedonesque for example  I have blocked your IP address for 24 hours for spamming and 3RR issues I will extend the block if needed  Im not at all into this subject so I wont be monitoring it closely but if other editors here notice issues please bring it to my attention,0.0

Yes the text is deliberately a secondary source because I and nobody else feels like going through Latin medieval texts all over Europe to find and compare some titles when 1 all serious secondary sources claim the same thing 2 wikipedia rules require secondary sources and for good and obvious reasons no original research etc In addition we have discussed the duke etc issue already under the Stephen article it is not as simple as it seems and my points have been completely ignored by you et al so why should I care in the first place right Secondly no normal Hungarian academic source calls Pribina a chieftain normal Hungarian academic sources ie those I know do not differ from Slovak Czech Austrian etc sources for the time period at hand Finally I would like to see contemporary sources for calling most of the early Arpáds Kopány etc princes etc which you do in this wikipedia and not chieftains lords etc and interestingly in these cases the word chieftain is really used also by academic sources but you are not proposing such a change those who know the circumstances in this wikipedia know the answer It would be also interesting to find contemporary sources for the founding of Rome in the mid8th century and so on And we could go on like this for many medieval European countries So dont be ridiculous,1.0

There are no periodic trends This sectionsentence is a bit wrong headed  Periodic trends are those which repeat from period to period eg noble gas behavior recurring What this really means to talk about is horizontal trends across the period What the article means to say I guess is that horizontal trends are due to a quantum shell filling and since 1s fills within 2 electrons theres not much scope to look at trends Its also perhaps worth noting that when Mendelev put the periodic table together he didnt know the noble gases existed so all he had to place from what would become period 1 was hydrogen,0.0

Please dont return the article to a misleading and innaccurate title The subject and the contents are not just about the hacking but about the controversy over the emails themselves Thats what most of the coverage in reliable sources discusses well beyond the hacking incident itself So a return to the former title would be very misleading and innacurate If there is a better title lets use that one but this one is a clear improvement over the improperly narrow title that was being used previously An articles title must reflect the article contents An effort was made to split off the controversy over the emails but that was reverted The present title is misleading as it addresses only the hacking a small part of the coverage and ignore the much bigger issue about what was in the emails and the ensuing controversy Im okay with having separate article on the hacking and the emails if thats the way to go but we cant have a distorted article that is titled and stilted to address the hacking only as if the emails themselves arent the center of the controversy and what makes the subject so notable,0.0

Commentedout material This article was a redirect for well over three years Then the following material was added on September 18 2007 Heres what I removed    Why NeoDarwinism   There is no one theory of NeoDarwinism The term is commonly used to refer to currently accepted mainstream ideas about evolution   which cannot properly be called Darwinian since Darwins hypothesis regarding the origin of the variation necessary for natural selection which he called Pangenesis is no longer accepted by most geneticists  Darwin recognised several problems with his theory which he was unable to solve In 1859 when his seminal book The Origin of Species was published nothing was known of DNA or genes and very little about cell biology He could not conceive of Mutation which is now considered to be the source of novel material in the evolutionary process His theory of Pangenesis which he published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication hypothesised that Gemmules his imagined forerunners of genes carried information to the next generation by accumulating in the germinal cells or zygotes and that they changed in response to use or disuse of the organs from which they were thrown off Though Darwin did not acknowledge any debt to Lamarck this was essentially a form a Lamarckism now rejected by most mainstream scientists  Despite the title of his book The Origin of Species Darwin did not explain speciation and he recognised a problem For natural selection to produce adaptive evolution he considered that the changes in individual organisms that were the material for selection had to be small Only then could successive generations move towards an optimum state for any trait If the changes whatever their origin were too large then they would constantly overshoot the desirable optimum producing offspring that were forever badly adapted This requirement for small change or Gradualism seemed destined to lead to stabilising selection which was inconsistent with the observed fact that different species have somehow broken away and become very different from each other  Darwin also assumed that characteristics were the result of blending inheritance the mixing of contributions of both parents In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication he presents abundant evidence from animal and plant breeders as well as common experience with human offspring suggesting that in general some sort of average of the two parents was produced though he recognised sports or throwbacks as the exception that was to him a mystery He could not see how such blending might lead to anything other than the gradual dilution of variation to the point of eventual elimination which conflicted with the possibility of speciation     History and Useage  The Ukranian I I Schmalhausen used the term in his seminal work Factors in Evolution which his colleague Theodosius Dobzhansky described by Steven J Gould as the central contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis described as very important to the synthesis He says p175 The Lamarckians based their theory on the premise of an already existing individual adaptability and did not examine its origin while the NeoDarwinians regarded it as unimportant since they assumed that the results of individual adaptability being noninheritable have no evolutionary value He also says p198 Unfortunately the more recent advances of genetics have promoted the spread of neoDarwinian concepts Morover adaptive modifications generally have not been accorded any place among the factors of evolution  The widely used school textbook Biology a Functional Approach says The Darwinian theory reappraised in terms of modern genetics is sometimes called neoDarwinism  Richard Dawkins uses the term to when referring to current ideas saying that idea means quite a complicated mixture of things but does not explicitly distinguish it from the ideas of the modern synthesis   Steven J Gould one of the most published evolutionary theorists of modern times used the term neoDarwinism frequently    Creationist articles often refer to the term neoDarwinism a fact that has led some people to conclude that the term is an invention of the creati,0.0

Rotten Tomatoes   WPMOSFILM and WPRTMC have several things to say about Rotten Tomatoes  Rotten Tomatoes started roughly in 2000 for films before then the score from Rotten Tomatoes is often deemphasized and put at the end of the critical response section as it is done in the case of this article   Weasel words like mostly should be avoided when the wording can be specific and the wording should be improved to avoid this  If you look at the reviews for Goldfinger you will see they are all dated post 2000 this can be specifically stated and vague weasel words avoided   An editor stated that the percentage given by Rotten Tomatoes is not the score and that the score was 84 but this was clearly an incorrect description Rotten Tomatoes describes 84 as the rating average It would probably be good to include the 84 rating average if editors feel the Rotten Tomatoes percentage is somehow dishonest   Keep comments on relevant article talk pages Do not make comments personal talk pages If you want to start a discussion on the talk page then better to actually start it than telling someone else to start it,0.0

Wondering If You Could Help   A couple of months ago I created a page for the Original Clark Sisters an American closeharmony singing group from the 1930s and 40s that was fairly wellknown at the time  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station includng being the host of a Trad Jazz show I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music  I properly referenced the article and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages  All in all I think I did a fairly good job considering it was only my first real page construction    So along comes this editor from the UK Seddon and marks the thing for speedy deletion  Before I can even find out about it the page is gone  Then when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page he totally ignores me  In the first place I cant understand how a UK editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on US music secondly if he is allowed why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page so that I dont have to go to all the trouble of recreating it at a loss of several hours of my time  Im also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to  Thanks for your time,0.0

You assume a lot I dont support Storms its not personal Storms is reliable source of a kind that requires caution he is clearly affiliated with cold fusion research However who should write a book on the topic Someone who has no experience with it Storms isnt simply editorializing expressing his opinions he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text As with any review of the field he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant and this then gives us a guide to what is notable in the field There are thousands of peerreviewed papers on cold fusion and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers He can use conference papers we cant but if he cites them that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference Because of the position of the field as to general opinion  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial including what is quite wellestablished such as excess heat If you dont think excess heat is reasonably wellestablished you should read the 2004 DoE review again and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound The claim that its all junk research quite simply cant be supported from any solid source only from what are really tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article in place of the much stronger Storms reference which is a secondary source Its like the media reports that Fleischmanns work was never replicated  In fact the core claim that excess heat was found when setting up highlyloaded palladium deuteride has been confirmed over and over The original radiation claims were bogus The research finding neutrons at moderate levels was bogus artifact and error The claim that the origin is nuclear and in particular that it is fusion is unproven In other words OCMV Im quite with the 2004 DOE review except that the field has shifted since then the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research such that negative replications typically now can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion  For example the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons The work is solid and published Aspects of it have been confirmed and I am indeed assuming that there will be more confirmation their work over almost twenty years has been quite solid and conservative theyve done proper controls etc The levels however are very low and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion there are all these apparently contradictory experiments I was just reading yesterday one protest that all these experiments produce different amounts of heat how come there is no consistency So what if you find neutrons this is inconsistent with the reported heat  Actually it isnt What that shows is that neutrons arent involved in whatever is generating the heat but that the energy source what I call the black box is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place For example take the Be8 hypothesis That will generate energetic alphas at 238 MeV These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level indeed it would be expected The alphas are found confirmed Miles et als work showed way back that helium generation is correlated with excess heat No excess heat no helium Excess heat helium in an amount proportional to the excess heat and the ration is at 25  5 MeV as reported by Storms and others Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure but Im not convinced that Krivit understands the problem If you dont capture all the helium you will get a higher figure and that is indeed what is found but with some experiments great care has been exercised to detect all the helium and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from dd helium fusion 238 MeV  One writer put this way Fleischmann didnt just discover some isolated island that could be specified by simple coordinates he found an entire continent and those who try to find the island find different things their reports vary all over the map literally We do not know to what extent lowenergy nuclear reactions are possible Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifactfree  Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed overall The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation this results from the conditions under which the work has been done Researchers dont want to at this point waste their time doing exactly what everyone else has done they want to,0.0

If you are here to tell me you replied to a comment of mine in a discussion dont bother unless its been a few days Ive probably got it watchlisted   Togeditwidth   Hi Werdnasomeone correctly noted at WPRequests for commentMay 2010 skin changeBug reportsWiden the edit box to fill the entire screen that the preferences option Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen doesnt actually do that I notice that you changed the wording of that option one year ago in rev49553 Two questions  Was that requested or discussed anywhere or more an adhoc wording and we can just tweak it to something like Widen the edit box to fill the available space  Why is that option in there in the first place Seems to me that width100 would be a good default for all installations and site admins can just tweak it in their installations CSS if they want Cheers    Meetup  You may well have seen a site notice about the next Cambridge meetup this Saturday 29 May I thought those who have been in the past should have a personal invite too      What the hell   What the hell is It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions like RfA instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others supposed to mean I have virtually no involvement with RFA and AFAIK am the single highest contributor of FAs to WPLONDON have you confused me with someone else  As per my initial comments when the BM scheme was announced I have serious reservations about creating formal ties between Wikipediawhose prime selling point is editorial independence and a neutral point of viewand with any one museum university or other institution Quite aside from the glaring COI issue of an organisation paying people to promote their exhibits nobody has even touched on the tax issues of paid editing being channelled directly or indirectly through the WMF As you may know Im generally supportive of the idea of paid editingI dont see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOVbut the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WPRequests for commentPaid editing      So you had serious and substantial reservations and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons Its like the Wikipedia version of Godwins Law  Ive already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in paid editing on the discussion page itself  Saying that the British Museum is paying people to promote their exhibits is at odds with the facts of this situation as Liam has explained I have no comment on tax issues and consider that outside of the communitys remit in any case  it can be dealt with by the Foundation if indeed money is being channeled through the latter Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me if youd like to make a big dramafest out of somebody offering incentives to write featuredquality articles about notable historical artifacts then I invite you to do so and see what response you get       No I had serious and substantial reservations as did David Cane and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced to his extreme credit and unlike you Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack Still waiting for that explanation of what It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions like RfA instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others is supposed to mean And no,0.0

Who is a vandal MrDinesh Kannambadi   Do not accuse others of being vandals  Because Ninlils intervention did not seem partial to you you have resorted to getting the page blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category howsoever inaccurate by Yellowmonkey  Now whom should the question be asked whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 116065 and finally demised in 11891192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many many years before them    Can we also be enlightened under what rules of Wikipedia not understood by vandals is this kind of editing and then awarding an article such as this riddled with holes is permissible,0.0

False accusations     I have been accused of sock puppeting yet they still havnt brought one single piece of tangible proof even though the other person claimed he was from mexico which I am from the states The main reason why I was initially blocked was because of Bigcat82 as his false accusations bias moderating lies misinformation and more lies7 different people have noted he was bias and still he is allowed to control the lion vs tiger section with only repeating its not reliable or not a peer journal none of this is true for instance his account where he put on lion vs tiger has been sitting there for going on 6 years and still no one has even peered into it it is a straight up lie that he said the lion was killed here is the full article of the 1909 fight  url  Miss informs people and twists facts he uses this tactics on the roman accounts leaving out who won in popmeii and following it in with a non credible source William bridges is not a historian but he uses it to capitalize on the archaeology book in fact that book roots to the fact the lion defeated the tiger as romanitalian sites says the tiger is being attacked by a lion url  He routes it to the usual that it was a leopard but the leopard mosaic is in the house of doves the lion standing over a prostrated tiger is in the house of faun Several members point out his major flaws such as Bbbeto as he states its not that the sources arnt reliable he just doesnt want anything that favors the lion and will show the lion as the usual winner its not that they arent peer jorunals its that the support the lion he has erased over 20 things not seeable now on the talk page and edit page it doesnt matter if its from a trainer if they support the lion he will call it unreliable and the rules dont applywhat rules Its only his rules there hasnt been a consensus done by 10 people at once going on over 6 years Is this what wiki is for for who ever is the more persistent and the better liar to be able to control wiki Its just his  and he should be banned from editing that topic since he is already a part of over 20 forums specifically on topic where he has been caught lying for instance he just said he has graduated from 10 universitys url  Really he graduated from 10 of the top university around the world Show us just one of them name the university show us who you studied under show us a copy of your diploma he is a pathological liar look under the bear contributions countless of people call him specifically a tiger fan look at the talk page there the lion vs tiger contribution only he is ever erasing things of favoring the lion Wikipedia mods should be ashamed for having a person use its search engine for a person pumping out his own propaganda and bias POV for this amount of time unchecked He now says that no experts favor a lion really Define expert if we look at what wiki has as expert url  We can see that an expert is someone who has prolonged experience or observation the topic is about them fighting so they have to have excerpts and citations of them seeing a fightno excerpts of them exist for the tiger so far yet he disputes people who does and is considered experts  Clyde beatty Terrel jaccobs Bert nelson Peter taylor Dave hoover Damoo dhotre Marco Peters Isablela thomas William blackburne George conklin Dave salmoni Samatha stephens Dr antle from big cat rescue Dr Frank mendel  There are alot of experts who favor the lion yet he will just lie and lie and lie that they dont just like the accounts there are 50 tigers killed by lions just from Clyde beatty alone  url  Lions have killed tigers hundreds of times theres even photo evidence of the combatants url url Yet the only one he accepts is the one to make like the lion is incapable of killing a tiger by highlighting they were small female ambushed ectgiving the appeal that lions dont stand a chance when in fact they are taller at the shoulder heavier as a species has more genuine experts who favor the lion over the tiger upon experience has killed more times then vice versa The article doesnt have to show a one sided one but a fair assessment should be brought in by atleast 10 peer reviewers of people who actually read the actual dam article instead of leaving lies and misinformation by the biggest bias liar on the web In fact i just left crumbs there I am not gona participate in aiding this topic on this search engine again you guys can manipulate the system and misinform people all you like I will take this info to a proper site where people like Bigcat82 and flatout aka false accusers and liars cant do anything about changing the truth,1.0

Your make a good point  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson  Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term often narrowly defined by language  This obviously has its limits  On the other hand the more broadly you define a civilization the more subgroupings it must include  Eventually we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand  And ultimately civilizations like religions are selfdefined  Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization  For another perspective I can turn to H Patrick Glenn in Legal Traditions of the World speaking on tradition and identity  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition or civilization  Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel who speaks of an underlying structure of civilization those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change or more probably disappearance of the tradition itself  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam  To summarize looking at the lands of Islam with its concept of Umma the shared traditions the shared Arabic religious and often secular language and indeed the shared religion of Islam it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization,0.0

I fail to see the distinction  Who better than legal scholars to define what the law is  Moreover my comments in re how legal scholars define the law were a response to your dubious assertion that law qua law can be defined as a decision process  That assertion has no place in the main law article    I disagree  The enactment of a statute falls under the topic of legislation    These issues are not law qua law they are topics which should be discussed under the ambit of particular legal topics such as statutory interpretation or contracts or related topics such as sociology and political science    Law qua law is first and foremost a body of knowledge  The academic field to which you refer is the study of that body of knowledge and should be considered as part and parcel of the discussion found in the main law article the profession of law is the application of that body of knowledge which should be discussed in the practice of law article,0.0

EESWARA CHEKAVA EZHAVAR   Summons everybody regarding tackling with Nair Vandals and also about SURNAMES of Ezhavar    Dear Ezhava friends I am a 6th Dan Black Belt in ShotoKhan  Karate  and also having 2 Degrees in both Kalarippayattu Vadakkan Style and Shawolin Kungfu  Wing Chun Style  hailing from an Orthodox Chekava Ezhavar family in north Malabar and also a Master in Law MLM and have been practicing in High Court  Our family is one of the reputed Chekava families in Kerala and trainers of Kalarippayattu for centuries And according to our family sayings our family was the leading Kalarithe temple for training Kalarippayattu  in kerala for training Vadakkan Style  Thekkan Style And hear that when Nairs and all came to Kerala they were very poor and good in character and were the servants of NamboothiriBrahminCaste One thing we are very proud with to tell that even centuries before the arrival of Brahmins  Nairs to kerala here our ancestors had made this martial art of Kalarippayattu well disciplined one and practiced with all of its systematized weaponry methods At that time we used the word Kalari to mean the training place from which word the name Kalarippayattu was derived After nairs had come here Nairs also started to study Kalarippayattu from our kalari traditions under strict disciplines Like the sameMuslims and Chritians also started mastering in the kalarippayattu from Chekava Ezhavar familiesYou can see so many Christian  Muslim kalari experts also in the history It doesnt mean that the kalarippayattu was brought from Arabia The Nairs also came here some centuries back But it had been a cultural martial orthodox tradition that was related to the blood of Malabar region as a part of its hereditary Chekava Society But the shameless Nair Society after coming here and after studying the tricks and techniques from the people inhibited here now would like to teach the world that they are the main practitioners of this martial art even when this martial art has been practiced here for thousands of years by the other people in this region If so MuslimsChristians also can start claiming that it was brought here from Arabia    But when the Brahmins Namboothiris started getting donations   Dhanam like lands golds and so many things in other kindfrom the rulers from our castes in ancient times   Brahmins became landlords Nairs also became Rich gradually when the nairs started a cheap system called Sambandhama system of giving Nair Women to any rich traveller people in their way like Namboothiri for using that woman for a short period of time comparing to marriage  to obtain and to posses the landshouses and their other assets held by those traveler  Namboodhiris I saw in the wikipedia website that this system was stopped by social reformers playing humiliating public Dramas in front of them with the help also of Gentle Nair MenBecause it was a system like which we cant see ever in the history or ever in the world even in the people inhabiting in jungles In the modern world it is not called as sambandham but we use some other words to denote these types of cultures The same shameless system what they used to obtain Brahmins assets now they use to obtain the reputation regarding Kalarippayattu What the ancestors of the Nairs did  was not a problem of Ezhavar It was just the problem of their ancestors We dont want to feel guilty conscious in their cultural tragedy We dont want to discuss about their past but what makes us this much angry is their intolerance in others traditional supremacy and brutal nature to destroy our public records because of jealousy Should we attack Nair websites in return of itNO We dont want to attack others But what we want to do is we want to grow ourselves and we want to let others also to grow This is our tradition We dont want to attack others and we dont want to posses others assetscultures And in one another point of view we can be proud also Because even though these castes trying to include us under their  Varna System we should know that we are just above of all of these systems and  when the Brahmins came to this place our ancestors could  give them enough Land and Accommodations and Houses considering they are Brahmins That is why the Brahmins use the word ILLAM for their housesBecause actually the word ILLAM meant for the houses of Ezhavar Still the historical word ILLAM is used for Ezhava Houses As the  Nairs were the workers of Namboothiris they also received some shares from the donations through Namboothiris and also by Sambandham But because of this inferiority complex nairs al,0.0

New title for subsection  drawn directly from the sources  An edit summary by User Viriditas reads as follows  cur  prev  Viriditas talk  contribs 17869 bytes Admission of verbal sexual harassment Thats not what the sources say You either go with the sources or you dont edit undo  I must have missed the memo that put User Viriditas in charge of all of Wikipedia  so I will assume good faith and overzealous good intent behind such a summary  However Viriditas is quite correct in saying go with the sources  So here goes  The sources in question reveal the following  A  The respected writer awardwinning VOA journalist Carolyn Weaver wrote in her article on the matter that Williams was   accused of verbally abusing female staff members over a period of at least four years  and  Unlike most incidents of sexual harassment in newsrooms the Williams case was widely reported largely because of its intersection with the Thomas hearings and the conflictofinterest question it raised  The terminology about this being about  inappropriate verbal conduct  came from Williams own apology on the topic which  quite understandably characterized the matter in as good a light as possible  A quite natural human characteristic  But not reflective of the allegations that the Washington Post investigated  The Howard Kurtz story in the Washington Post reveals this  Washington Post Magazine reporter Juan Williams said yesterday that the newspaper has disciplined him for what he called wrong and inappropriate verbal conduct toward women staffers and he apologized to his colleagues  But Kurtz went on to report that  emphasis in italics added  Williamss letter came several hours after about 50 female employees met with Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr and said they objected to The Posts refusal to say how the paper had resolved allegations of verbal sexual harassment against Williams    So there is the source for the new title of the subsection  allegations of verbal sexual harassment,0.0

Ive read a few articles and its getting frustrating There is literally nothing they all agree on The reason why all judgements are subjective and no one is an expert Even in usually reliable sources like eg the BBC theyre just puff pieces I think the 1st paragraph of the section is ok about how the films not meant to be realistic as are the last 3 self lacing shoes hoverboards and the Cubs but Im beginning to think the discussion of what it did and didnt get right should be removed entirely Instead replace it with a generic Especially around 2015 many articles speculated on what the movie did and didnt get right followed by a few links,0.0

Good point but I cant help to notice the editing history of this article and how it reflects continued polarization against and for it Im not going to implement the same edits again in the Reception and Criticism section if they are once again reversed I still support the truism that most RPGplayers with an opinion on this game either love it or hate it and that the game technically is a sequel within the Final Fantasy universe X2 is simply a direct sequel But like I said if you guys do not want that edit to stay in the R and C section I will not include it again in the same context since it seems so far that several people disagree with that last sentence,0.0
So are you saying you dont think the section in the body of the article is sufficient  Additionally I think adding such a category in the first sentence is not a neutral point of view especially considering that I checked other prominant figures on Wikipedia and they do not have a similar designation especially not in the first sentence of their articles  Additionally while you may disagree with his philosophies and religious beliefs I do both myself I dont think the term is neutral fair or correct especially given his response to the controversy which I assume was the inception of the addition  added by millernumber1,0.0

UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES    unblockHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE  It had been six years since we had graduated from college and for the first time since graduation all three of us were together again From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable  Having returned to my cozy semisecluded home in the suburbs we all sat in the living room sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives With the exceptions of the location  a house  and the presence of alcohol it could have been any of our final two years of college together The three of us tightknit friendswithbenefits sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together Then Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad now they were muchwelcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend  As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justines skin and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulderlength brown hair As when we were in college together she wore virtually no makeup just a thin gloss upon her lips  an enticing strawberry flavor as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening  and red fingernails Her red dress was indeed elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the welltoned thigh The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes Surprisingly however she wore hoop earrings something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe  The conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other I took the opportunity to once again study Beth and was equally impressed While noticeably shorter than Justine Beth was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research As in college Beth preferred the color black for her outfits a somewhattight sweater formfitting slacks and a pair of low heels Four tiny earrings adorned each ear plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril Beths black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine  It felt so good to be in their presence once again Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy but for now I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa  The intimacy began when we finally went to bed together I was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder An arm wrapped around each of them I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest dipped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed caressed my stiffening manhood My eyes closed I reveled in their touches inherently familiar yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time  No words were needed And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me I smiled to myself in the darkness having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters But eventually their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep I stayed awake a little longer immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life  I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee faint yet unmistakable Justine was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while Beth and I held each other as she slept The feel of her pajamacovered breasts against me was a welcome sensation as it had been over a year since I had last even hugged a woman Simply waking up in the morning and not finding myself alone in bed was a tremendous thrill in itself walking up with Beth in my arms made the morning extremely special for me  Gently I kissed her forehead and she stirred in my arms She was clearly lost in that odd hazy phase between sleep and consciousness as she nudged me to my back and lay upon me Underneath the covers I slowly caressed her as I kissed the top of her head A few minutes later as Beth finally awoke and lifted her head to give me a semiconscious smile Justine nudged open the bedroom door and carried three mugs of coffee on a tray  Just like old times seeing you two like that Justine quipped with a smile Beth simply giggled softly awakening further as I held her a little tighter  Deciding we wanted bagels for breakfast I headed out into the snow and to a familyowned bagel shop a few blocks away When I returned my two beautiful guests were still upstairs and I was not at all surprised to open the bedroom door and find that Justines sleep shirt had been removed she knelt upon the bed straddling Beths waist as each woman lovingly touched each other  Just like old times seeing you two like that I parroted with a smile Justine simply laughed softly her eyes inviting me to join them While it was indeed tempting I knew that they both would want  and need  some intimate time alone together so despite my growing erection I simply approached the bed long enough to give each of them a gentle kiss to the cheek before retreating from the bedroom closing the door to allow them their privacy  As I sat in the dining room with a bagel and a newspaper I eventually heard Justines beautiful cry and instantly knew that I had made the correct decision in leaving my two longtime friends alone upstairs Simply imaging what Beth had possibly done to produce such an exquisite sound was arousing in itself and I found my hand stroking slowly at the front of my jeans  After my guests had eaten while Justine showered Beth and I retired to the living room Sitting on the sofa with the stunning young woman straddling my lap I gazed deep into her eyes as she gently stroked my chest through my sweatshirt After a few moments our lips naturally drew together the slow kiss at once warm and electrifying  My hands wandered from Beths shoulders to her chest squeezing her breasts gently and feeling her contented moan I slowly began to unbutton her pajama shirt as the kiss continued baring her torso to my view once she leaned back from me and helped me to remove the black garment  Bite me hard she requested breathily just like you use to do  Rising up on her knees Beth leaned toward me offering a breast to my lips My hands cupping her lower cheeks I took the proffered nipple into my mouth sucking gently like a newborn baby for a few moments before trapping the lengthening bud between my teeth and tugging gently The change in breathing above me signaled that I was doing exactly as she wanted as she perhaps needed and I tugged a bit harder then a bit harder then a bit harder  Then I bit her firmly at the base of the nipple Her hands stiffened at the back of my head and the hiss above me was unmistakable My own hands moving up her back to hold her in place I bit her again harder holding the bite for several seconds before releasing her breast from my mouth For a moment I looked fondly upon the markings left behind by my teeth then switched to her other breast and bit my longtime friend again the soft groan evidence that I was indeed hurting her  With one arm still wrapped around her back my free hand moved between her thighs and began to stroke her sex through the pajama bottoms and panty she wore I felt Beth shudder as I bit her again  harder  and stroked her with a little more force I continued biting her and stroking her enjoying her sounds of hurt and delight drawing the sweet nectar from her so that I could feel it upon my fingers despite the two layers between my hand and her sex Eventually however I stopped biting her alternately simply kissing and suckling each breast I stroked her with more force as she moved against my hand until finally her orgasm overtook her her hands clutching my head to her chest and her powerful heavy breaths irregular and full of desire and thankfulness  As Beth calmed I kissed her between her breasts directly over her heart and she lowered herself so we could share a warm kiss  You two make a nice picture  Blushing and giggling softly as we held each other Beth and I both turned toward Justine for a moment then Beth hid her,1.0

FY 2015 budget request   Hi On March 4 2014 Obama submitted his fiscal year 2015 budget request to Congress Ive started an article about it  President Obamas fiscal year 2015 budget proposal I was hoping other editors would be interested in improving the page and wanted to invite you to do so I was also hoping to get other editors input on how to insert a link or two to the article on this page possibly in the section about economic policy It could be something simple like  President Barack Obama submitted his fiscal year 2015 budget request for 39 trillion to Congress on March 4 2014  Or longer with more information about what is in the proposal there is a ton of relevant material that could be used like  President Barack Obama submitted his fiscal year 2015 budget request for 39 trillion to Congress on March 4 2014 The presidents budget proposal was described as a populist wish list Some of the proposed programs include more spending on preschool education tax credits for childless lowincome workers and most than 1 trillion in new and higher taxes The Presidents proposal was also considered a playbook for Democrats electionyear themes of creating jobs and narrowing the income gap between rich and poor  As I said there is a lot of material  defense spending taxes education etc  that could be included Does anyone have any comments on what they think this should say or where in the article it should appear Thanks,0.0
Odd  the 9th Legion seems to have got a kicking everywhere it went No not the same battle Clearly there are now at least three in Britain we know about The first was in Scotland where a night attack took place on a fort the second was when the 9th was reformed and marched North into Scotland never to be seen again The third involved Boadicea who was a warlordess way to the South who seems to have given the 9th its THIRD reformation another kicking  Reading more about the first attack it seems to fit very nicely into your Night Combat article because it succeeded only because it was carried out at night  an advance unit snuck in the fort opened the gates and the hordes rushed in Classic They appear to have succeeded because the Romans couldnt even get their armour on in time let alone form up in any sort of defensive phalanx Interesting,0.0

Sinhalese Nagas  It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island Origins of the Hela Race Hela was combination of Raksha Yaksha Deva Naga   Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles At the time of start writing the history Raksha and Deva wasnt powerful Naga was the most powerful authorities That time only they had kingdoms It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna Others lived as small groups  kuvenis story   Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya After 23 generations from Pandukabhaya kings tend to suffix Tissa and Naga to their names Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms  most probably Nagadeepa made connections to the royal family in Rajarata Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain NagaSinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata    It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king Those days without having clear power king cant survive Yakshas had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families Since conflicts between tribes hasnt been ended NagaSinha king wasnt be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas Ritigal Jayasena was one of them  So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna SL was unified on tribe basis After SL was converted to buddhism it wasnt required to unify tribes which based on religion Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism due to fear for Asoka Rajarata king could made his brother  MahaNaga as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas,0.0

I recommend a critical review of the score sample from Trio en chaconne If you compare it with the edition in WIMA youll notice the initial motive in WIMAs edition has the notes   4g  2d 8a 16g 16a  2b  in the right hand upper part while the sample in the Wikipedia article has  4g  2c 8a 16g 16a  2b  Unfortunately Ive not access to the original printing of Livre dOrgue But from a music analysis point of view it seems obvious that the leading motive spans the chord on the first degree of the key in use in practice gminor The 2c found in the Wikipedia sample seems most unlikely to me,0.0

Apology to Jeremy   Hi Jeremy Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality sexual activity with those of the same gender your race the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces and then perform fellatio at an unsatisfactory level to even myself The list continues of course on and on and on I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour and for that I am ashamed  So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language and next time I have any conflcit with you I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner I will not call you demeaning names like faggot nigger kike cocksucker faggot asshole son fo a bitch faggot motherfucker etc I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all Please accept my apology and know that whatever your lifestyle I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally Sincerely Michelle Rollins,1.0

Its not really an abbreviation in the sense you mean its two words combined to make a new name In that sense it just becomes a proper noun The thing with forex is that it actually refers to foreign exchange and is thus an abbreviation whereas Pasmo is simply the name of something and the etymology is not crucial to its function as such  And even if you insist that its an abbreviation theres still no reason for it to appear in allcaps The forex page on Wikipedia doesnt even use allcaps for forex so that kind of dumps your argument not to be rude but this is the case   Also note that EBay when refering to itself on its website and in reports etc starts sentences with eBay but the Wall Street Journal quite rightly follows convention and begins such sentences with EBay  I find the trend of using allcaps when there is no basis for doing so highly annoying It also quite simply goes against wellestablished rules of style Regardless of what style the company forces its English translators and copywriters to follow probably against their will for the corporate website and materials Wikipedia is free to follow normal English conventions Wikipedia does not have to support the companys misguided use of SHOUTING which is and this is an unverifiable statement based on experience probably due to a lack of understanding of English style conventionsor a refusal to accept them even after they have been explainedrather than due to an informed decision based on whether the name constitutes an acronymabbreviation or not The name should appear as Pasmo,0.0

Kri on Wikipedia we do not treat fringe views in the same way that we treat mainstream views  Mainstream views are typically presented without fringe commentary  However the reverse is not true at all  Fringe views are frequently subject to considerable criticism from mainstream sources  This is a mainstream article and WPUNDUE dictates that it is to be free from fringe commentary  Conversely Michael Cremos claims should not be presented to the reader without criticism from mainstream sources  This has the dual function of preserving the integrity of Wikipedia and also preventing every article from becoming an article about a controversy style article like Shakespeare authorship question or Ancient Egyptian race controversy  And believe me you do NOT want every article to be like Ancient Egyptian race controversy,0.0

I deeply apologize for overlooking your last two messages of Jan 3 until today  Im still new at this and I simply didnt see them although I certainly should have  Anyway your pictures of the Richards building are great  Some of them such as the fullheight shots of the western service tower and the two towers flanking the main entrance arent available anywhere else as far as I know The porch photos certainly help to illustrate the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor  This collection of photos will benefit anyone who is studying what is generally considered to be Kahns breakthrough work  If you dont mind I might make minor changes to some of the descriptions  In particular you correctly identified the two types of shafts in the photo taken from the garden on the south side so I would remove the question marks from that description  If you ever get a chance to visit the OlivettiUnderwood Factory building near Harrisburg that would be great especially since that article doesnt have any photos at all  I suspect however that the building will be difficult to photograph  The standard books on Kahns work usually include a shot of one of its 72 mushroomshaped moreorless structural units while it was under construction one of the entire building taken at an angle from an airplane and one of the old entrance that was apparently at the northeast corner  The old entrance seems to have been closed so from the ground on the outside options today seem to be limited    It still might be possible however to take a photo that gives viewers a feel for the size and shape of one of those 72 mushroom units which would be very helpful  When I follow the link in that article to the aerial photo of the building I see that those units might be most visible and accessible from the west side so perhaps a meaningful photo could be taken of the mushroom unit in the northwest corner of the building  You would want to emphasize the west side of that mushroom unit which has an indentation separating it from the next unit to the south which should help to visualize its shape  The north side of that mushroom has a triangular protrusion between it and the next mushroom to the east which I suspect would obscure its shape  Frankly Im not sure how well this will work from the ground but it is worth a try  Depending on the light it might work better to try a similar photo of the mushroom unit on the northeast side of the building where I think the old entrance used to be again deemphasizing the protruding triangle on the east side if possible  Also perhaps there is a visitors area in the entrance lobby where photos of the internal structure of that mushroom unit are permitted  Good luck and thanks again,0.0

This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl MEASUREMENTS The Northern PygmyOwl has a body length of 7  8 inches a wingspan of 15  16 inches and weighs about 2  2 12 ounces   HABITAT This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows lakes coastline and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America   DIET The main diet of the Northern PygmyOwl is small birds and rodents and large insects Occasionally they will eat reptiles and amphibians Pygmyowls are diurnalactive during the day and crepuscular active at dusk and dawn hunters This owl will search for prey from a perch pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found  REPRODUCTION The Northern PygmyOwl nests in tree cavities The female usually lays 3  5 eggs Unlike most owls which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid the pygmyowl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20  30 days later The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year   NAME DERIVATION The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux indicating a little owl glaukidion meaning to gleam or glare and may refer to the eyes of the owl and gnoma referring to knowledge reasoning or an opinion The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl  INTERESTING FACTS  Unlike hawks falcons and eagles owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus called a crop to store extra food Therefore owls like pygmyowls will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later This is especially important for small highenergy species that must eat frequently   Since pygmyowls are active during daylight they rely on their sense of sight to hunt Consequently this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing silent flight nor exceptional night vision like nocturnal owls,0.0

history of bingo   The Early Roots   Bingo as we know it today is a form of lottery and is a direct descendant of Lo Giuoco del Lotto dItaliaWhen Italy was united in 1530 the Italian National Lottery Lo Giuoco del Lotto dItalia was organized and has been held almost without pause at weekly intervals to this date Today the Italian State lottery is indispensable to the governments budget with a yearly contribution in excess of 75 million dollars  In 1778 it was reported in the French press that Le Lotto had captured the fancy of the intelligentsia In the classic version of Lotto which developed during this period the playing card used in the game was divided into three horizontal and nine vertical rows Each horizontal row had five numbered and four blank squares in a random arrangement The vertical rows contained numbers from 1 to 10 in the first row 11 to 20 in the second row et cetera up to 90 No two Lotto cards were alike Chips numbered from 1 to 90 completed the playing equipment Players were dealt a single Lotto card then the caller would draw a small wooden numbered token from a cloth boag and read the number aloud The players would cover the number if it appeared on their card The first player to cover a horizontal row was the winner  In the 1800s educational Lotto games became popular A German Lotto game of the 1850s was designed to teach children their multiplication tables There were other educational Lotto games such as Spelling Lotto Animal Lotto and Historical Lotto Even in todays highly competitive toy and game market Lotto is holding its own Milton Bradley sells a Lotto game featuring the Sesame Street Muppets The game is designed to provide children in the 3 to 6 year age range with a splash of fun while at the same time teaching them to count and recognize numbers   Beano   It was an evening in December of 1929 when a very tired New York toy salesman Edwin S Lowe decided to drive on to Jacksonville Georgia so that he might have an early start for his next days appointments The year before with two employees and 1000 capital Lowe had set up his own toy company Soon after the market crashed and the outlook for his budding firm looked bleak indeed  A few miles from Jacksonville Lowe came around a bend in the road and was greeted by the bright lights of a country carnival he was ahead of schedule so he parked his car and got out All of the carnival booths were closed except one which was packed with people Lowe stood on tiptoes and peered over the shoulders of the participants The action centered on a horseshoe shaped table covered with numbered cards and beans The game being played was a variation of Lotto called Beano The pitchman or caller pulled small numbered wooden disks from an old cigar box and at the same time called the number aloud The players responded by eagerly checking their card to see if they had the number called if so they would place a bean on the number This sequence continued until some someone filled a line of numbers on their card  either horizontally vertically or diagonally This feat was marked by the shout of Beano The winner received a small Kewpie doll  Ed Lowe tried to play Beano that night but he recalls I couldnt get a seat But while I was waiting around I noticed that the players were practically addicted to the game The picthman wanted to close up but every time he said This is the last game nobody moved When he finally closed at 300 am he had to chase them out  After locking up the pitchman told Lowe that he had run across a game called Lotto while traveling with a carnival in Germany the previous year His immediate thought was that it would make a good tent or carnival game He made a few changes in its play and a change of the name to Beano The game proved to be such a surefire crowd pleaser and money maker that on his return to the United States he continued to work the game on the Carnival circuit  Bingo   Returning to his home in New York Lowe bought some dried beans a rubber numbering stamp and some cardboard Friends were invited to his apartment and Ed Lowe assumed the pitchmans duties Soon his friends were playing Beano with the same tension and excitement as he had seen at the carnival During one session Lowe noticed that one of his players was close to winning She got more excited as each bean was added to her card Finally there was one number left  and it was called The woman jumped up became tongue tied and instead of shouting Beano stuttered BBBBINGO  I cannot describe the strange sense of elation which that girls cry brought to me Lowe said All I could think of was that I was going to come out with this game and it was going to be called Bingo  The earliest Lowe Bingo game in two variations  a twelve card sert for one dollar and a two dollar set with twentyfour cards The game was an immediate success and put Lowes company squarely on its feet  Although the name Bingo could very well have been trademarked the game itself having come out of the public domain had little chance of being protected Imitators came out of the woodwork once the success of Lowes game was evident Lowe was very gracious about the whole affair He asked his competitors to pay him a dollar a year and to call their games Bingo too A small price to pay to avoid litigation  and this the name became generic  Bingo Cards and Insane Mathamaticians   Several months after Bingo hit the market Lowe was approached by a priest from WilkesBarre Pennsylvania The Father had a problem in his parish A fast thinking parishoner had come up with the idea of using Bingo as a way to get the church out of its financial troubles The priest had put the scheme into operation after having bought several sets of Lowes 200 Bingo game However problems developed immediately when it was found that each game produced half a dozen or more winners Lowe could immediately see the tremendous fund raising possibilities of Bingo but at the same time he realized that to make the game workable on this large of a scale a great many more combinations of numbers would have to be developed for the cards To accomplish this Lowe sought the services of an elderly professor of mathematics at Columbia University one Carl Leffler Lowes request was the the professor devise 6000 new Bingo cards with non repeating number groups The professor agreed to a fee that remunerated him on a per card basis As the professor worked on each card became increasingly difficult Lowe was impatient and toward the end the price per card had risen to 100 Eventually the task was completed The ES Lowe Company had its 6000 cards  at the expense of the professors sanity  The church of WilkesBarre was saved and after it a Knights of Columbus Hall in Utica New York Word spread fast  I used to get thousands of letters asking for help on setting up Bingo games said Lowe  so many that he published Bingos first Instructional Manual This effort was followed by a monthly news letter called The Blotter absorbs all Bingo news which was distributed to 37000 subscribers By 1934 there were an estimated 10000 Bingo games a week and Ed Lowes firm had a thousand employees frantically trying to keep up with demand  nune entire floors of the New York office space and 64 presses printing 24 hours a day   we used more newsprint than the New York Times According to Lowe the largest Bingo game in history was played in New Yorks Teaneck Armory  60000 players with another 10000 being turned away at the door Ten automobiles were given away Bingo was off to a fast start and at the same time had reserved itself next to baseball and apple pie  thanks to Ed Lowe and the loss of Professor Lefflers sanity,0.0

Opening paragraph is nonNPOV   I consider this line in consideration of the labor provided for free over several centuries without which the United States would likely have never attained its wealth and global power to be nonneutral a personal opinion and a unsubstantiated claim While African slavery in the 1700s and 1800s did have a huge impact on the agricultural community in the south as well as strong political ramifications during the same time period  I consider it quiet a stretch to claim that its likely that without slaves the US wouldnt be the global super power it is today  The USAs current dominant status in global politics and economics is derived directly from the events leading up to and the outcomes of WWII I see no correlation between the industrial manufacturing and production capabilities which originally brought the US power during the 1940s to slaves who worked in the cotton fields over 100 years prior to the attaining of wealth and power in these modern times  If someone wants to try and justify this fire away,0.0

I was one of the people who removed that part Erm well my reason is that while it may do good as a separate article i doubt if we need to see how nairs had sex and how their women were classified in this article Besides i doubt if this relates to the Nairs alone It could be included if suitable in the Kamasutra article or something rather than in this article I am not so sure on seeing a part that goes into details on ways of sex and how women were classed and on what basis and the male privilege to enjoy her in every conceivable way For one even if u argue its a work by a nair it doesnt need mention on the nair page Secondly dont u think its a little too explicit in details You dont find articles on other castes stating the ways they had sexual intercourse etc So i vote for removing that part,0.0

IntroductionSecond Paragraph The source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written  The article makes legal distinction between CFS BC and CFS national  It doesnt support a broad assertion that as you say The CFS generally referred to legally consists of 3 separate organizations the national CFS a provincial chapter and CFSServices which are often collectively referred to as CFS  Also The organizations generally brand themselves as CFS and do not make the distinction between the branches Your source does not support that statement Also brand is a corporate term and not NPOV language  Also In addition it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the CFS defacto one organization Is not supported by the one source you provided  See the reliable sources policy Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made  WPRELY  Simon Frasers The Peak has a well established and long time editorial bias against CFS so Im not sure if the article you use is even considered a reliable source  Again check WPRELY for all the details  This also seems to be directly related to the defederation issues in BC the article you use as evidence seems to speak more to what went on in BC last winter,0.0

Pessimism v optimism in Beckett   I have an issue with the statment Becketts work is    deeply pessimistic about the human condition as found in the first paragraph I changed deeply to deceptively and it was immediately changed back I dont know how to contact the subsequent editor directly so Ill post this here by way of discussion  Perhaps replacing deeply with deceptively is not the best fix but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth as fact an opinion that is widley open to interpretation  Becketts writings arent just about the journey If they were deeply pessimistic would be nearly undebatable Theyre just as much about the destination or at least the goal And while he frames lifes journey as a slog through shit his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywoods prowar propaganda movies have proven again and again the more monstrously you portray the obstacle the larger looms the hero who overcomes them The same is true in Beckett the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable but the journey continues heroically The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark but hes faced towards the light distantan unattainableas it may be  The essential Beckett quote isnt I cant go onfull stop its I cant go on Ill go on  Now I may not have convinced you personally that Becketts work is more optimistic than pessimistic But perhaps Ive made a case that a flatly factual statement like Becketts work is stark    and deeply pessimistic about the human condition is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias   Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you He once said that if he were a pessimist he wouldnt write  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work that ought to count for something,0.0

A Chelseapersona page sounds excellent but too much resistance There has been too much arguing to reach a broad consensus for a better solution about Manning Ideally we could reredirect Chelsea Manning to a new page Chelsea Manning persona to summarize all the massive coverage about Chelsea Manning in the new persona plus the history of the new name along with the monthsyears Breanna which led to this notable new name then include some background leading to the old spy persona Bradley Manning A similar fork has been made with Audie Murphy as the page primarily about his military career but then his major acting career is covered by Audie Murphy filmography even though he was far more famous as an actor for 21 years with older films even shown on network television stations to millions of viewers who did not study World War II In fact I was stunned when I read the intro of page Audie Murphy and it failed to mention actor songwriter in the first sentence only in the infobox Clearly Manning will be remembered far more years as the transgender whistleblowerspy because in recent years whistleblowers are a dime a dozen even after leaking numerous secret documents Perhaps many years from now we will have automated subarticle wizardbots which will follow obvious rules of notability eg counting related news articles over years from 5000 top newspapers and then recommend creating a 2nd article in cases where a person has 2 major identities with vast sources about each unable to provide NPOVbalanced text within just one page without seeming wpUNDUE text with the massive details about the newer persona The transgender spy is a huge huge storyline which will echo for years much like a person who later became an actor but under an alias name as compared to the ordinary whistleblower who as just one of many,0.0

The problem I have is that from my understanding London the region of England is the exact same thing as London the city Both are conurbations and have no administrative role within UK Government This article is currently suggesting that London as a city is only a convention when really there is a legal entity know as London the region which effectively acts as the capital city of the United Kingdom I agree that Greater London and London are separate entities and deserve separate articles however currently there are two articles cover the same region known as London I think that the region known as London should removed from the Greater London article and this article should show that London is a region commonly described as a city Regards,0.0

Michael Myers edit   First of all I am not being disruptive I realise that you have been doing this longer than I have so you feel you are more qualified than I to make decisions in editingAs for my Michael Myers H3 edit Yes it is trivia But trivia has a place in these matters And I know this because after an exhaustive search through the Wiki pedia guidlines I can find nothing that supports your theory that trivia is for IDMP not WikipediaAnd I quoteWikipedia does not have firm rules Rules on Wikipedia are not carved in stone and the spirit of the rule trumps the letter of the rule Be bold but not reckless in updating articles and do not worry about making mistakes Your efforts do not need to be perfect prior versions are saved so no damage is irreparable So the H3 connection is trivia It doesnt hurt anything or anyone exceptperhaps you and your sensibilitiesI will continue to add it in I thinkfrom what I have read in Rules  Guidlines that if you should decide to report me for being disruptive that Wikipedia will not side with you I hope you will change your mind on this and see it as  I do a bit of trivia that creates a possibly threadthin connection in the Halloween series and actually is one of the few reason that H3 should even be named a Halloween film And even you would have to admit having 3 in the title makes it part of the series even if Michael is not the main focus of the film Thank you TheMitch1966,0.0

Sandbox proposal for Wikipedia Belarusian geographical names   I just read  and I applaud you for undertaking this effort However while I appreciate the idea of using the romanization as used by the Belarusian government as the basis the transliterationtranscription seems to be inconsistent between the various layers of government That is the website of the central government uses other romanizations than the websites of the regions For instance the website of Gomel Region uses Yelsk and Oktiabrskiy while the website of the central government uses Elsk and Oktyabrskii In addition in your sandbox I find forms that are used on neither website You write Svietlahorsk while both the central government website and the Gomel Region website use Svetlogorsk  If this proposal is to have any chance of being adopted I think it should as much as possible try to use the same source for most of its transcriptions The central government website seems the most logical choice to me  However unfortunately I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with the romanizations used by that website Heres a few reasons why  the transcription of iotation  palatalization is wildly inconsistent  in some names iotationpalatalization is not marked Elsk Svetlogorsk  in others iotationpalatalization is marked using the letter y Oktyabrskii Kostyukovka  in yet others the letter i is used for the same purpose Liozno  in still others the letter j is employed Marjina Gorka  sometimes in one part of the word iotationpalatalization is marked while it isnt in another part of the same word Myadel Cyrillic  pronounced   the ending  is inconsistently romanized Compare Oktyabrskii and Pervomaiskiy as a bonus observe that the first i in Pervomaiskiy is a transcription of  which on the rest of the map is usually transcribed as y  Observing these inconsistencies I am not convinced that using these romanizations is the solution While BGNPCGN may not be perfect it is at least consistent If this this and this are the alternatives I think we should stick to our existing policy of using BGNPCGN,0.0

European Court of Human Rights ECHR Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event  This must be added to the article On 17 December 2013 the case Perinçek v Switzerland application no 2751008 European Court of Human Rights ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide Perinçek said Armenian genocide is an international lie ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçeks right of freedom of expression Article 10 ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict  a In November 2007 The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence  b In February 2012 the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research  c The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that laws that penalized the expression of opinions about historical facts were incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights imposed on States parties  and that the Covenant did not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past eventsECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide Perinçek said Armenian genocide is an international lie  I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915 Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey However Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached     Intolerance and Impatience of Armenian or close to Armenian Guys About the COUNTER ideas on 1915 Events  The user Erpert THREATENED TO BLOCK me in my talk page  via the pretext that  1 using of talk page for inappropriate discussion  2 Adding defamatory content  That is why the discussion of 1915 Events cannot be continued objectively One of the sides Armenians do not want to hear any counter thoughts let alone to see a counter writing in such a FREE Wikipedia environment     References,0.0

Do not be pathetic I do not take antiPolish views and do not make antiPolish edits Unless of course you consider deleting Polish POV as making antiPolish edits Provide evidence if you believe it is not so Also I am by far not the only one to react to your behaviour here  You ask me about my nationality I will not tell you as I believe nationality does not matter on Wikipedia However contrary to you I am not at the same time 1 a self declared Czech when talking to editors with Czech ancestry 2 a European since the beginning of this calendar year and 3 a Pole whose grandfather was active in preparations of the Polish occupation of Zaolzie when talking to your fellow Polish editors  If you talk about your achievements why do you not mention that you were several times blocked once even by Jimbo Wales for personal attacks or incivility Why do you keep quiet about being desysoped because of bad behaviour in a dispute relating to ethnic issues  In relation to the latest edits in Cieszyn and Český Těšín the Austrian census of 1910 do you still believe there were no Czechs in town or did you not know at that time  It is not a POV pushing from my side I would do the same for the Czech minority if some would be here   Do seriously think of your approach You have my sympathies in preserving Polish traditions and ethnicity in Teschen Silesia but I will keep on strongly opposing your POV insertions They do not belong here This is Wikipedia,1.0

Actually what usually happens is that we have the person contact the Volunteer Response Team via email They can then gather information privately outside the public forums of talk pages to confirm your identity And remember that this is done as a protective measure Its just as easy for an imposter to create an account and claim to be the subject of an article as it is for the actual subject to create an account Thats why unless OTRS has vetted the situation we take a skeptical view to people who claim to be the subject of an article That said an account claiming to be a more major celebrity such as Lady Gaga would be blocked until theyd contacted OTRS to confirm their identity,0.0
